     sane behavior for most commands; it makes them stop processing input if they can't write it
     anywhere.

     We don't like being killed uncleanly like that. By ignoring SIGPIPE, the write() syscall that
     normally would cause a SIGPIPE instead throws an EPIPE exception. We handle exceptions and
