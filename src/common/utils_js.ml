 * There seems to be a bug in OCaml 4.01 that causes `include Utils` in this
 * file to generate an interface for this file that is merged with the interface
 * for Utils -- but is somehow not type compatible with it.
 *
 * The only workaround I could find was to require that downstream users of both
 * utils.ml and utils_js.ml explicitly refer to both :(
 *
 * If at some point we are able to deprecate support for 4.01, we should
 * consider re-instating the following line and using Utils_js as a direct
 * extension of utils.ml.
