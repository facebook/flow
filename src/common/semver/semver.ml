  Basic semantic version parser, as defined by http://semver.org/

  So far, this implementation only supports individual versions; intersection
  ranges (e.g. ">=0.13.0 <0.14.0", which are ANDed together); and caret ranges,
  which allow changes that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit (e.g.
  "^0.13" expands into ">=0.13.0 <0.14.0", and "^0.13.1" expands into
  ">=0.13.1 <0.14.0", whereas "^1.2.3" expands into ">=1.2.3 <2.0.0").

  Further support for features like "||" ("1.2.3 || 1.2.5"), hyphen ranges
  ("1.2 - 1.3"), X-ranges ("1.2.x" or "1.2.*"), tilde ranges ("~1.2"), and
  pre-release/build identifiers ("1.2.3-beta.1"), will be added as necessary.
