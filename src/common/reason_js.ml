(* This module defines a general notion of trace, which is used in modules
   Type_inference_js and Flow_js to record how the typechecker reasons about
   code, systematically collecting, simplifying, and solving constraints. This
   is extremely useful, not only for debugging the typechecker but also to
   really understand why an error is reported. *)

(* Eventually, trace information should be printed out only in verbose mode,
   since Flow reports all errors it finds and the trace for every error can get
   quite detailed dependening on how far apart the "source" and "sink" are and
   how convoluted the flow between them is. *)
