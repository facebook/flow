(* This module defines a general notion of trace, which is used in modules
   Type_inference_js and Flow_js to record how the typechecker reasons about
   code, systematically collecting, simplifying, and solving constraints. This
   is extremely useful, not only for debugging the typechecker but also to
   really understand why an error is reported. *)

(* Eventually, trace information should be printed out only in verbose mode,
   since Flow reports all errors it finds and the trace for every error can get
   quite detailed dependening on how far apart the "source" and "sink" are and
   how convoluted the flow between them is. *)

(* Reasons are included in types mainly for error reporting, but sometimes we
   also use reasons in types to recover information on the source code that
   caused those reasons to be created. Two examples of such secondary uses of
   reasons are:

   - strictness analysis: we use reasons to locate the origin of an object and
   the origin of an operation on the object, and use such origins to determine
   whether certain errors should be suppressed.

   - termination analysis: we use reasons to limit instantiation of type
   parameters in polymorphic types at particular locations, to prevent the type
   checker from generating an unbounded number of constraints. The `pos` field
   of reasons is sufficient to distinguish code locations, except that as an
   implementation strategy for checking polymorphic definitions, we walk over
   the same source code multiple times to check it with different instantiations
   of type parameters, and to index "copies" of the reasons created in those
   passes over the same source code, we use an additional `test_id` field.

(* Instantiable reasons identify tvars that are created for the purpose of

   and should be fixed, for various benefits including but not limited to more
   precise type inference. But meanwhile we need to consider results of property
   accesses that might result in sentinel property values as constants to decide
   membership in disjoint unions, instead of asking for unnecessary annotations
   to make progress. According to Facebook's style guide, constant properties
   should have names like CONSTANT_PROPERTY, so we bet that when properties with
   such names are accessed, their types have the 0->1 property.

   As an example, suppose that we have an object `Tags` that stores tags of a
   disjoint union, e.g. { ACTION_FOO: 'foo', ACTION_BAR: 'bar' }.

   Then the types of Tags.ACTION_FOO and Tags.ACTION_BAR are assumed to be 0->1.
