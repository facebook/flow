(* Module implementing the recommended way to augment a map.

   Without this API, we end up using the lower-level Map.union API. But
   Map.union sometimes has unexpected results because the order of the two
   arguments matters when there's overlap. (It's implemented as a Map.fold of
   Map.add, which has the effect of adding the bindings in the first argument to
   the second argument.)

   Instead, Augmentable(Map).augment map ~with_bindings makes the intention
   explicit, and is implemented by simply passing the arguments in the correct
   order to Map.union.
