val add: 'a t -> 'a -> unit

(* Unions the two elements. If either (or both) element does not exist, add it. *)
val union: 'a t -> 'a -> 'a -> unit

(* ACCESSORS *)

 * already present. *)
val find: 'a t -> 'a -> 'a

(* Returns all members in the same set as the given element. Raises `Not_found` if the given element
 * is not already present. *)
