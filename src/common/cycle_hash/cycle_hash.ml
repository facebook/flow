(* Given a possibly-cyclic directed graph where each node has a hash, this
 * module propagates bits along dependency edges.
 *
 * For example, traversing the graph (C -> B -> A) has the effect of
 * incorporating A's hash into B and that updated B's hash into C.
 *
 * The traversal handles cycles by finding strongly connected components
 * (Tarjan's algorithm) and computing a component hash, which is assigned to
 * each node in the component.
 *
 * For a detailed description of Tarjan's algorithm, see:
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan's_strongly_connected_components_algorithm
 *
 * The method of computing a cyclic hash takes inspiration from the interning
 * logic from Skip (https://github.com/skiplang/skip) which also computes hashes
 * for potentially cyclic graphs of objects.

(* Once we have a cycle, we compute it's hash by visiting the cycle, combining
 * hashes from dependency nodes.
 *
 * Because we find cycles by a recursive traversal, the order of nodes in the
 * cycle is arbitrary. To keep cycle hashes stable, we sort the component by
 * it's local hash value and take the minimum element as the root of the
 * traversal.
 *
 * Recall that nodes in this cycle still have the on_stack field set. We abuse
 * this field as a kind of mark bit here. When we see a node with on_stack set,
 * we know that it is part of the cycle. When we visit the node, we unset the
 * field, to record that we've already visited that part of the cycle. *)
