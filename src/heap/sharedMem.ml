   * Each entity stores its version number. There is also a global version
   * counter. Each version corresponds to a "slot" which is either 0 or 1. We
   * compute the slot from the version by taking the least significant bit.
   *
   * Entities support reading committed data concurrently with updates without
   * synchronization. The global version counter can not be updated
   * concurrently, however.

  (** Compressed OCaml values

      LZ4 decompression requires the precise compressed size in bytes. To
      recover the precise byte size, we use a trick lifted from OCaml's
      representation of strings. The last byte of the block stores a value which
      we can use to recover the byte size from the word size. If the value is
      exactly word sized, we add another word to hold this final byte.
