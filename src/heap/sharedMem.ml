   * We can use skip lists to store sets of values supporting concurrent search,

   *
   * Insertion and deletion operations are lock-free, search is wait-free.
   *
   * This is a "textbook" implementation taken from Herlihy et al's "The Art of
   * Multiprocessor Programming" 2nd Edition, section 14.4. It builds on the
   * implementation from the Multicore OCaml runtime. This implementation
   * differs from those implementations in the following ways:
   *
   * 1) The `preds` array populated by `sklist_find` does not contain pointers
   *    to the predecessor node itself, but pointers to predecessor node's
   *    forward pointer at the given level.
   * 2) There are no sentinel head/tail nodes. We don't need the head node due
   *    to (1) since preds can contain contain pointers to the list object's
   *    forward pointers. Instead of a tail node, we use NULL_ADDR to indicate
   *    the end of a list.
   * 3) We rely on sharedmem GC to reclaim space from deleted nodes
   *
   *)

  (* To provide log(n) operations, we need enough levels depending on the

  (** Compressed OCaml values

      We store OCaml values as serialized+compressed blobs in the heap. The
      object header stores both the compressed size (in words) and the size (in
      words) of the buffer needed to hold the decompressed value.

      LZ4 decompression requires the precise compressed size in bytes. To
      recover the precise byte size, we use a trick lifted from OCaml's
      representation of strings. The last byte of the block stores a value which
      we can use to recover the byte size from the word size. If the value is
      exactly word sized, we add another word to hold this final byte.
