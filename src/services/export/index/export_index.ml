(** Custom ordering where the "kind" (LibFile vs SourceFile vs JsonFile, etc) does
    not matter, and we compare filenames without extensions, so that something like
    [Foo.example.js] sorts _after_ [Foo.js] even though [e] comes before [j]; the
    extension is less important than the rest of the basename and we should suggest
    [import ... from 'Foo'] before [import ... from 'Foo.example']. *)

  if k <> 0 then
    k
  else
    String.compare a b

(** Custom ordering where [declare module] comes first, followed by source files,
    followed by globals.

    When importing, builtins are more commonly used and so are more
    likely to be what you want than a source file that shadows the name. Globals
    are unlikely to be what you want and come last.

    TODO: this is a very coarse ranking. We could do much better. For example, we
    could track how commonly used each export is. For example, the `Promise` global
    is probably far more common than any source file exporting the same name. *)
