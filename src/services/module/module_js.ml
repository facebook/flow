(* This module is the entry point of the typechecker. It sets up subtyping
   constraints for every expression, statement, and declaration form in a
   JavaScript AST; the subtyping constraints are themselves solved in module
   Flow_js. It also manages environments, including not only the maintenance of
   scope information for every function (pushing/popping scopes, looking up
   variables) but also flow-sensitive information about local variables at every
   point inside a function (and when to narrow or widen their types). *)

 * A set of module.name_mapper config entry allows users to specify regexp

(* Repick providers for modules that are exported by new and changed files, or
   were provided by changed and deleted files.

   For deleted files, their exported modules, if in old modules, will pick a
   new provider, or be left with no provider.

   For changed files, their exported modules, if in old modules, may pick
   the same provider (i.e., the changed file) or a new provider (a different
   file). If not in old modules, they may pick a new provider (i.e., the
   changed file) or the same provider (a different file).

   For new files, their exported modules may pick a new provider (i.e., the new
   file) or the same provider (a different file).

   Suppose that:
   new_or_changed is a list of parsed / unparsed file names.
   old_modules is a set of removed module names.

   Modules provided by parsed / unparsed files may or may not have a
   provider. Modules named in old_modules definitely do not have a
   provider. Together, they are considered "dirty" modules. Providers for dirty
   modules must be repicked.

   Files that depend on the subset of dirty modules that either have changed
   providers or are provided by changed files will be rechecked.

   Preconditions:
   1. all files in new_or_changed have entries in InfoHeap (true if
   we're properly calling add_parsed_info and add_unparsed_info for every
   parsed / unparsed file before calling commit_modules)
   2. all modules not mentioned in old_modules, but provided by one or more
   files in InfoHeap, have some provider registered in NameHeap.
   (However, the current provider may not be the one we now want,
   given newly parsed / unparsed files.)
   3. conversely all modules in old_modules lack a provider in NameHeap.

   Postconditions:
   1. all modules provided by at least 1 file in InfoHeap have a provider
   registered in NameHeap, and it's the provider we want according to our
   precedence and scoping rules.

   We make use of a shadow map in the master process which maintains
   a view of what's going on in NameHeap and InfoHeap, mapping module
   names to sets of filenames of providers.
   TODO: this shadow map is probably a perf bottleneck, get rid of it.

   Algorithm here:

   1. Calculate repick set:
   (a) add all removed modules to the set of modules to repick a provider for.
   (b) add the modules provided by all parsed / unparsed files to the repick set.

   2. Commit providers for dirty modules:
   (a) For each module in the repick set, pick a winner from its available
   providers. if it's different than the current provider, or if there is no
   current provider, add the new provider to the list to be registered.
   (b) remove the unregistered modules from NameHeap
   (c) register the new providers in NameHeap
