(**
 * This module computes whether a type is considered covered. It does so by
 * visiting the type until a "concrete" constructor is found. We consider a
 * constructor concrete if it has some runtime significance. So for example the
 * arrow constructor and the object constructor are concrete, whereas the union
 * or the intersection constructors are not. This means that whenever we encounter
 * a union we need to visit its parts to determine if this is a covered type.
 *
 * Some constructors that we, perhaps controversially, consider concrete are:
 *  - AnyWithLowerBoundT
 *  - AnyWithUpperBoundT
 *  - BoundT
 *  - KeysT
 *  - ExistsT
 *
 * In addition to being considered concrete the above constructors are also
 * considered covered.

     * Type variables may appear in a cycle in the dependency graph, which requires

     * stages of tvar resolution w.r.t coverage:
     *
     * - The tvar has not been seen before (there is no entry in tvar_cache). In this
     *   case we descend into the lower bounds of the tvar, marking its binding as
     *   Started in the tvar_cache.
     *
     * - The tvar has been seen and has been resolved (status = Done _). In this case
     *   we reuse the cached result.
     *
     * - The tvar is in the process of resolution (status = Started).
     *   These are types of the form:
     *
     *     type X = X | number
     *              ^
     *   we consider the recursive occurence as uncovered (Any). This case should
     *   be rare and it's arguable if we should be allowing it in the first place,
     *   so we assign the value that corresponds to the fewest guarantees.
