(* Expressions can be in one of four states:
   - Uncovered: This is an any or any-like type and is not covered by Flow.
   - Empty: This is an empty type, representing unreachable code, and is not covered by Flow.
   - Tainted: This is covered in that it has a static type, but trust analysis has indicated
              that this type may not accurately represent its type at runtime.
   - Untainted: This is covered, and its static type can be shown to accurately reflect
              its runtime type.
