(** keywords to suggest in a statement (or expression statement) context, in
    almost-alphabetical order.

    the order here only matters amongst items with the same starting letter.
    for example, const is more common than class, which is more common than
    catch or continue; function is more common than finally.

    this way, when you type `c` and Quick Suggest triggers, we'll suggest
    [const, class, ...], instead of [case, catch, class, const, continue].
    you can also trigger Quick Suggest without typing anything (cmd+space),
    but that's sorted purely alphabetically. *)
