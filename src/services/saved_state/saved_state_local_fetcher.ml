(* This saved state fetcher is intended to be used mainly by tests. It assumes that there are 2
 * files next to /path/to/root/.flowconfig:
 *
 * /path/to/root/.flow.saved_state - the saved state file
 * /path/to/root/.flow.saved_state_file_changes - newline separated list of files which have changed
 *
 * if either file doesn't exist then we assume there's no saved state
