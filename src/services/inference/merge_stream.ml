(* Custom bucketing scheme for dynamically growing and shrinking workloads when
   merging files.

   We start out with files that have no dependencies: these files are available
   for scheduling merge jobs. All other files are "blocked", i.e., they are *not
   ready* for scheduling.

   NOTE: Scheduling merge jobs too early will cause crashes, since they will
   need stuff that has not been computed yet! A more sophisticated scheme may be
   designed to be tolerant to such failures, but the merge process is
   complicated enough as is. Also, performance-wise blocking does not seem to be
   an issue because files get unblocked pretty regularly (see below).

   Each blocked file maintains a counter on the number of files blocking
   them. As files are done, they decrement the counters of other files blocked
   on them. As soon as some of the counters go to zero, the corresponding files
   are made available for scheduling.

   Finally, we maintain a counter on the total number of blocked files. When
   that goes to zero, we prepare to exit!

   The underlying worker management scheme needs to know when to wait for more
   work vs. when it can safely exit. We signal the former by returning a `None`
   bucket, and the latter by returning a `Some []` bucket.
