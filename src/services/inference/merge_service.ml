(* To merge the contexts of a component with their dependencies, we call the
   functions `merge_component_strict` and `restore` defined in merge_js.ml
   with appropriate reqs prepared below.

   (a) orig_sig_cxs: the original signature contexts of dependencies outside the
   component.

   (b) sig_cxs: the copied signature contexts of such dependencies.

   (c) impls: edges between files within the component

   (d) dep_impls: edges from files in the component to cxs of direct
   dependencies, when implementations are found.

   (e) unchecked: edges from files in the component to files which are known to
   exist are not checked (no @flow, @noflow, unparsed). Note that these
   dependencies might be provided by a (typed) libdef, but we don't know yet.

   (f) res: edges between files in the component and resource files, labeled
   with the requires they denote.

   (g) decls: edges between files in the component and libraries, classified
   by requires (when implementations of such requires are not found).
