(* To merge the contexts of a component (component_cxs) with their dependencies,
   we call the functions `merge_component_strict` and `restore` defined
   in type_inference_js.ml with appropriate arguments prepared below.

   First, we check the requires of component_cxs.

   Next, we traverse these requires, creating:

   (a) orig_sig_cxs: the original signature contexts of dependencies outside the
   component.

   (b) sig_cxs: the copied signature contexts of such dependencies.

   (c) impls: edges between contexts in component_cxs and sig_cxs that
   are labeled with the requires they denote (when implementations of such
   requires are found).

   (d) res: edges between contexts in component_cxs and resource files, labeled
   with the requires they denote.

   (e) decls: edges between contexts in component_cxs and libraries, classified
   by requires (when implementations of such requires are not found).

   The arguments (b), (c), (d) are passed to `merge_component_strict`, and
   argument (a) is passed to `restore`.
