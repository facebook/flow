(* sketch of baseline incremental alg:

   Note: this is for strict mode only, which is the easy case,
   since it doesn't require a transitive merge of all modules
   connected via nonlocal type flows.

   Total case over set of modules M:
    1. for all m:M, do local inference on m, producing graph m.g
    2. for all m:M, for all r:m.required,
      perform substitution of r.export into m.g, producing m.g'

   Incremental case, given previously established modules m:
    1. Mt = (touched) reparse of all m:M where m.file has been updated
    2. for all m:Mt do local inference on m, producing m.g
    3. Mx = (export) m:Mt where m.export or m.name have changed
    4. Md = m:M where m.file has been deleted
    5. Mr = (recheck) m:Mt | (M where !empty(m.required & (Mx | Md))
      (all touched modules plus all others whose required sets
       include any export changes or deletions)
    5. for all m:Mr, for all r:m.required,
        perform substitution of r.export into m.g, producing m.g'

(** A note on terminology.

    We say that a file F1 "depends on" another file F2 if F1 has a
    require/import that "resolves" to a module "provided by" F2.

    The "depends on" relation induces edges in a "dependency graph" with files
    as nodes. This dependency graph is often represented as a map from files to
    sets of files they depend on.

    When F1 depends on F2, i.e., there is an edge from F1 to F2 in
    the dependency graph, we say that
    - F2 is a "direct dependency" of F1
    - F1 is a "direct dependent" of F2.

    When F1 transitively depends on F2, i.e., there is a path from F1 to F2 in
    the dependency graph, we say that
    - F2 is in "all dependencies" of F1
    - F1 is in "all dependents" of F2.

    Sometimes we drop the word "all," so in general "dependencies" and
    "dependents" on their own should be taken to mean "all dependencies" and
    "all dependents." Correspondingly, sometimes we use the qualifier "direct"
    to describe non-transitive dependencies and non-transitive dependents.

    Also, sometimes we use the word "reverse dependency" instead of "dependent."

    How do we calculate the dependency graph and the dependent graph? It comes
    down to understanding what "depends on" really means. Recall that F1
    "depends on" F2 when F1 depends on some resolved module that is provided by
    F2. Since the "provides by" function is not injective, maps from files to
    (sets of) modules and back that compose to give the dependency graph and the
    dependent graph are useful intermediate data structures.

(* Identify the direct dependents of new, changed, and deleted files.

   Files that must be rechecked include those that immediately or recursively
   depended on modules whose providers were affected by new, changed, or deleted
   files. The latter modules, marked "changed," are calculated earlier when
   picking providers.

   - candidates is the set of files which could be dependents. The returned sets will be subsets of
   the candidates set. For example, if we're calculating the dependents of all the changed files
   then this would be the set of unchanged files
   - root_files is the set of files for which we'd like to calculate dependents. This should be
   disjoint from candidates. If we wanted to calculate the dependents of all the changed files then
   this would be the set of changed files
   - root_modules is the set of modules for which we'd like to calculate dependents. If we wanted to
   calculate the dependents of all the changed files then this would be the set of module names
   which have new providers.
