(* sketch of baseline incremental alg:

   Note: this is for strict mode only, which is the easy case,
   since it doesn't require a transitive merge of all modules
   connected via nonlocal type flows.

   Total case over set of modules M:
    1. for all m:M, do local inference on m, producing graph m.g
    2. for all m:M, for all r:m.required,
      perform substitution of r.export into m.g, producing m.g'

   Incremental case, given previously established modules m:
    1. Mt = (touched) reparse of all m:M where m.file has been updated
    2. for all m:Mt do local inference on m, producing m.g
    3. Mx = (export) m:Mt where m.export or m.name have changed
    4. Md = m:M where m.file has been deleted
    5. Mr = (recheck) m:Mt | (M where !empty(m.required & (Mx | Md))
      (all touched modules plus all others whose required sets
       include any export changes or deletions)
    5. for all m:Mr, for all r:m.required,
        perform substitution of r.export into m.g, producing m.g'
