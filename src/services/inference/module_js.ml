(* This module is the entry point of the typechecker. It sets up subtyping
   constraints for every expression, statement, and declaration form in a

   Flow_js. It also manages environments, including not only the maintenance of
   scope information for every function (pushing/popping scopes, looking up
   variables) but also flow-sensitive information about local variables at every
   point inside a function (and when to narrow or widen their types). *)

(* Note that the module provided by a file is always accessible via its full
   path, so that it may be imported by specifying (a part of) that path in any
   module system. So, e.g., a file whose full path is /foo/bar.js is considered
   to export a module by that name, so that it is always possible to import it
   from any other file in the file system by using a relative path or some other
   file system navigation convention. The Node module system relies on this
   basic setup.

   In addition, a file may or may not export its module by another name: this
   name is typically shorter, but can be used unambiguously throughout the file
   system to import the module, and this access mechanism is somewhat robust to
   moving files around in the file system. Thus, /foo/bar.js may also export its
   module by the name Bar, using a custom module system like Haste, either
   explicitly (by mentioning Bar in the file) or implicitly (following some
   convention), so that it can be imported from any other file in the file
   system by the name Bar. Other combinations are possible: e.g., all files in a
   directory may export their modules via paths relative to a package name, and
   files elsewhere in the file system can import those modules by providing
   paths relative to that package name. So, e.g., /foo/bar.js may export its
   module via the name Foo/bar.js, with the name Foo may be specified in a
   config file under /foo, and other files may still be able to import it by
   that name when the /foo directory is moved to, say, /qux/foo. *)

(* inferred is a list of inferred file names.
   removed is a set of removed module names.
   modules provided by inferred files may or may not have a provider.
   modules named in removed definitely do not have a provider.

   Preconditions:
   1. all files in inferred have entries in InfoHeap (true if
   infer is properly calling add_module_info for every file
   successfully inferred)
   2. all modules not mentioned in removed, but provided by one or more
   files in InfoHeap, have some provider registered in NameHeap.
   (However, the current provider may not be the one we now want,
   given newly inferred files.)
   3. conversely all modules in removed lack a provider in NameHeap.

   Postconditions:
   1. all modules provided by at least 1 file
   in InfoHeap have a provider registered in NameHeap, and it's the
   provider we want according to our precedence and scoping rules.

   We make use of a shadow map in the master process which maintains
   a view of what's going on in NameHeap and InfoHeap, mapping module
   names to sets of filenames of providers.

   Algorithm here:
   1. add all removed modules to the set of modules to repick a provider for.
   2. add the modules provided by all inferred files to the repick set.
   3. for each module in the repick set, pick a winner from its available
   providers. if it's different than the current provider, or if there is no
   current provider, add the new provider to the list to be registered.
   4. remove the unregistered modules from NameHeap
   5. register the new providers in NameHeap
