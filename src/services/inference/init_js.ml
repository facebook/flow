(* This module sets up the definitions for JavaScript globals. Eventually, this
   module should become redundant: we should be able to automatically interpret
   TypeScript type definition files for these and many other primitives. That
   said, in some cases handcoding may turn out to be necessary because the type
   system is not powerful enough to encode the invariants of a library
   function. In any case, this part of the design must be revisited in the
   future. *)
