           *
           * 1. Lets us infer types in spreads that are more inline with user expectations
           * by allowing inline declarations to overwrite properties on the left that
           * would cause an error if they were not inline. For example:
           * {...{| foo: number |}}, [string]: string}. If we did not account
           * for inline declarations, this spread would be an error even though there
           * is a reasonable way to interpret the type.
           *
           * 2. Lets us write better error messages when we spread an object with an optional
           * property after an inexact object. The accumulator may be inexact because we encountered
           * an inexact object earlier in the spread, but the reason for the accumulator refers to
           * the entire spread. Instead of pointing to that reason as the inexact object, we
           * can keep track of the most recently seen inexact object and point to that instead.
           *
           * We still have room for improvement for the error messages here. When we spread
           * an inexact object on the right, we may overwrite keys that came before, so
           * we error. Unfortunately, we point to the accumulator (the entire sperad) and say that
           * a key in the accumulator may be overwritten by the inexact object spread. That
