           * 2. The most recent reason that the accumulator (object on the left) is inexact
           *
           * 1. Lets us infer types in spreads that are more inline with user expectations
           * by allowing inline declarations to overwrite properties on the left that
           * would cause an error if they were not inline. For example:
           * {...{| foo: number |}}, [string]: string}. If we did not account
           * for inline declarations, this spread would be an error even though there
           * is a reasonable way to interpret the type.
           *
           * 2. Lets us write better error messages when we spread an object with an optional
           * property after an inexact object. The accumulator may be inexact because we encountered
           * an inexact object earlier in the spread, but the reason for the accumulator refers to
           * the entire spread. Instead of pointing to that reason as the inexact object, we
           * can keep track of the most recently seen inexact object and point to that instead.
           *
           * We still have room for improvement for the error messages here. When we spread
           * an inexact object on the right, we may overwrite keys that came before, so
           * we error. Unfortunately, we point to the accumulator (the entire sperad) and say that
           * a key in the accumulator may be overwritten by the inexact object spread. That
           * is a little confusing when you have types like these:

             * causes spurious errors. The config object produced here has a literal object
             * reason-- and it should! It's a new fresh object. It's also important that this
             * object is a literal so that it gets the less strict type checking behavior when
             * flowing to the Component's props. Many Props types are not specified as
             * read-only, so this literal reason is required in order to get the
             * covariant property type checking.
             *
             * However, literal objects flowing to object types with optional properties will
             * take on optional properties in the object types. This behavior is spooky, but
             * in place because we do not have a proper aliasing analysis.
             *
             * In order to avoid accidentally comparing optional properties from the Props
             * that may be adopted by the config to React$TransportValue, we flow each property
             * to React$TransportValue directly. If a dictionary is present then we also flow
             * the dict's value type to React$TransportValue. If the object is Inexact then
             * we also flow mixed to React$TransportValue to represent properties that may
             * exist but are not present in the type. This case will always error, but is
             * unlikely to be hit because it requires an inexact object to be spread into
             * the props in jsx.
