(** Garbage collection (GC) for graphs refers to the act of "marking" reachable
    type variables from a given set of "roots," by following links between type
    variables and traversing their concrete bounds.

    We mark only those dependencies that may contribute to errors. In
    particular, only type variables that are indirectly reachable via concrete
    bounds are marked; directly reachable type variables via links are not
    marked, since Flow's algorithm ensures that their concrete bounds are
    already propagated.

    This is useful for pruning the graph, i.e., removing type variables in a
    graph that make no difference when the graph is merged with other graphs
    through its requires and exports. **)

(* GC can be made more precise by respecting "polarity," which is just a fancy
   name that indicates the direction of walking: when a type variable is
   reached, we can walk only its lower bounds or its upper bounds based on the
   direction of the walk at that point.

   However, a directed walk requires determining the polarity of every part of
   every type. For some types, like those for functions, objects, arrays,
   etc. this is fairly standard. But for several other types, it is non-trivial
   to determine polarity: to do so, we need to carefully analyze how they appear
   in the flow rules, and whether their parts switch sides when those rules are
   simplified. Determining the wrong polarity in even one case can lead to
   hard-to-find bugs: at best, things crash because a type variable is reached
   that was marked unreachable, leading to a crash; at worst, a dependency is
   missed, leading to missed errors.

   The type visitor has an in-progress, conservative polarity calculation. It is
   conservative in that any "unknown" or unimplemented polarity is treated as
   Neutral, so we will preserve both lower bounds and upper bounds. *)
