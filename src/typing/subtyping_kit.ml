  (* Subtyping of arrays is complicated by tuples. Currently, there are three
     different kinds of types, all encoded by arrays:

     1. Array<T> (array type)
     2. [T1, T2] (tuple type)
     3. "internal" Array<X>[T1, T2] where T1 | T2 ~> X (array literal type)

     We have the following rules:

     (1) When checking types against Array<U>, the rules are not surprising. Array
     literal types behave like array types in these checks.

     * Array<T> ~> Array<U> checks T <~> U
     * [T1, T2] ~> Array<U> checks T1 | T2 ~> U
     * Array<X>[T1, T2] ~> Array<U> checks Array<X> ~> Array<U>

     (2) When checking types against [T1, T2], the rules are again not
     surprising. Array literal types behave like tuple types in these checks. We
     consider missing tuple elements to be undefined, following common usage (and
     consistency with missing call arguments).

     * Array<T> ~> [U1, U2] checks T ~> U1, T ~> U2
     * [T1, T2] ~> [U1, U2] checks T1 ~> U1 and T2 ~> U2
     * [T1, T2] ~> [U1] checks T1 ~> U1
     * [T1] ~> [U1, U2] checks T1 ~> U1 and void ~> U2
     * Array<X>[T1, T2] ~> [U1, U2] checks [T1, T2] ~> [U1, U2]

     (3) When checking types against Array<Y>[U1, U2], the rules are a bit
     unsound. Array literal types were not designed to appear as upper bounds. In
     particular, their summary element types are often overly precise. Checking
     individual element types of one array literal type against the summary
     element type of another array literal type can lead to crazy errors, so we
     currently drop such checks.

     TODO: Make these rules great again by computing more reasonable summary
     element types for array literal types.

     * Array<T> ~> Array<Y>[U1, U2] checks Array<T> ~> Array<Y>
     * [T1, T2] ~> Array<Y>[U1, U2] checks T1 ~> U1, T2 ~> U2
     * [T1, T2] ~> Array<Y>[U1] checks T1 ~> U1
     * [T1] ~> Array<Y>[U1, U2] checks T1 ~> U1
     * Array<X>[T1, T2] ~> Array<Y>[U1, U2] checks [T1, T2] ~> Array<Y>[U1, U2]

     * When do we consider a polymorphic type <X:U> T to be a subtype of another

     * research. A rule that works (Cardelli/Wegner) is: force U = U', and prove
     * that T is a subtype of T' for any X:U'. A more general rule that proves
     * that U' is a subtype of U instead of forcing U = U' is known to cause
     * undecidable subtyping (Pierce): the counterexamples are fairly
     * pathological, but can be reliably constructed by exploiting the "switch"
     * of bounds from U' to U (and back, with sufficient trickery), in ways that
     * are difficult to detect statically.
     *
     * However, these results are somewhat tricky to interpret in Flow, since we
     * are not proving stuff inductively: instead we are co-inductively assuming
     * what we want to prove, and checking consistency.
     *
     * Separately, none of these rules capture the logical interpretation of the
     * original subtyping question (interpreting subtyping as implication, and
     * polymorphism as universal quantification). What we really want to show is
     * that, for all X:U', there is some X:U such that T is a subtype of T'. But
     * we already deal with statements of this form when checking polymorphic
     * definitions! In particular, statements such as "there is some X:U...")
     * correspond to "create a type variable with that constraint and ...", and
     * statements such as "show that for all X:U" correspond to "show that for
     * both X = bottom and X = U, ...".
     *
     * Thus, all we need to do when checking that any type flows to a
     * polymorphic type is to follow the same principles used when checking that
     * a polymorphic definition has a polymorphic type. This has the pleasant
     * side effect that the type we're checking does not itself need to be a
     * polymorphic type at all! For example, we can let a non-generic method be
     * overridden with a generic method, as long as the non-generic signature
     * can be derived as a specialization of the generic signature.
