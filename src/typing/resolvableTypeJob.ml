(* Helper module for full type resolution as needed to check union and
   intersection types.

   Given a type, we walk it to collect the parts of it we wish to resolve. Once
   these parts are resolved, they must themselves be walked to collect further
   parts to resolve, and so on. In other words, type resolution jobs are created
   and processed in rounds, moving closer and closer to full resolution of the
   original type. Needless to say, these jobs can be recursive, and so must be
   managed carefully for termination and performance. The job management itself
   is done in Graph_explorer. (The jobs are naturally modeled as a graph with
   dynamically created nodes and edges.)

   Here, we define the function that creates a single round of such jobs.
*)

(* A datatype describing type resolution jobs.

   We unfold types as we go, looking for parts that cannot be unfolded
   immediately (thus needing resolution to proceed).

   The handling of these parts involve calls to `flow` and `unify`, and is
   thus decoupled from the walker itself for clarity. Here, we just create
   different jobs for different parts encountered. These jobs are further
   processed by bindings_of_jobs.

   Briefly, jobs are created for the following cases. (1) Annotation sources
   need to be resolved. (2) So do heads of type applications. (3) Resolved
   tvars are recursively unfolded, but we need to remember which resolved
   tvars have been unfolded to prevent infinite unfolding. (4) Unresolved
   tvars are handled differently based on context: when they are expected
   (e.g., when they are part of inferred types), they are logged; when they
   are unexpected (e.g., when they are part of annotations), they are
   converted to `any`. For more details see bindings_of_jobs.
