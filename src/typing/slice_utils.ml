(* Object Spread *)
(*****************)

exception CannotSpreadError of Error_message.t

(* Compute spread result
 * We keep around a few pieces of extra information in addition to the slices:
 * 1. Whether or not the slice was declared in line
 * 2. The most recent reason that the accumulator (object on the left) is inexact
 *
 * 1. Lets us infer types in spreads that are more inline with user expectations
 * by allowing inline declarations to overwrite properties on the left that
 * would cause an error if they were not inline. For example:
 * {...{| foo: number |}}, [string]: string}. If we did not account
 * for inline declarations, this spread would be an error even though there
 * is a reasonable way to interpret the type.
 *
 * 2. Lets us write better error messages when we spread an object with an optional
 * property after an inexact object. The accumulator may be inexact because we encountered
 * an inexact object earlier in the spread, but the reason for the accumulator refers to
 * the entire spread. Instead of pointing to that reason as the inexact object, we
 * can keep track of the most recently seen inexact object and point to that instead.
 *
 * We still have room for improvement for the error messages here. When we spread
 * an inexact object on the right, we may overwrite keys that came before, so
 * we error. Unfortunately, we point to the accumulator (the entire sperad) and say that
 * a key in the accumulator may be overwritten by the inexact object spread. That
 * is a little confusing when you have types like these:
 *
 * type A = {| foo: number |};
 * type B = {| bar: number |};
 * type C = {baz: number};
 * [1] type D = {...A, ...B, ...C} // Error, C is inexact and may overwrite foo in [1]
 *              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
