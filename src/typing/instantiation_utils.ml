(* We maintain a stack of entries representing type applications processed
   during calls to flow, for the purpose of terminating unbounded expansion of
   type applications. Intuitively, we may have a potential infinite loop when
   processing a type application leads to another type application with the same
   root, but expanding type arguments. The entries in a stack contain
   approximate measurements that allow us to detect such expansion.

   An entry representing a type application with root C and type args T1,...,Tn
   is of the form (C, [A1,...,An]), where each Ai is a list of the roots of type
   applications nested in Ti. We consider a stack to indicate a potential
   infinite loop when the top of the stack is (C, [A1,...,An]) and there is
   another entry (C, [B1,...,Bn]) in the stack, such that each Bi is non-empty
   and is contained in Ai. *)
