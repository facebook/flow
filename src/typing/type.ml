(* Some types represent definitions. These include numbers, strings, booleans,
   functions, classes, objects, arrays, and such. The shape of these types
   should be fairly obvious.
   Other types represent uses. These include function applications, class
   instantiations, property accesses, element accesses, operations such as
   addition, predicate refinements, etc. The shape of these types is somewhat
   trickier, but do follow a pattern. Typically, such a type consists of the
   arguments to the operation, and a type variable capturing the result of the
   operation. A full understanding of the semantics of such types requires a
   look at the subtyping relation, described in the module Flow_js. *)

(* Every type has (or should have, if not already) a "reason" for its
   existence. This information is captured in the type itself for now, but
   should be separated out in the future.
   Types that represent definitions point to the positions of such
   definitions (or values). Types that represent uses point to the positions of
   such uses (or operations). These reasons are logged, chained, etc. by the
   implementation of the subtyping algorithm, that effectively constructs a
   proof of the typing derivation based on these reasons as axioms. *)

    (* type expression whose evaluation is deferred *)
    (* Usually a type expression is evaluated by splitting it into a def type
       and a use type, and flowing the former to the latter: the def type is the
       "main" argument, and the use type contains the type operation, other
       arguments, and a tvar to hold the result. However, sometimes a type
       expression may need to be kept in explicit form, with the type operation
       and other arguments split out into a "deferred" use type `defer_use_t`,
       whose evaluation state is tracked in the context by an identifier id:
       When defer_use_t is evaluated, id points to a tvar containing the result
       of evaluation. The explicit form simplifies other tasks, like
       substitution, but otherwise works in much the same way as usual. *)

    (* A polymorphic type is like a type-level "function" that, when applied to
       lists of type arguments, generates types. Just like a function, a
       polymorphic type has a list of type parameters, represented as bound
       type variables. We say that type parameters are "universally quantified"
       (or "universal"): every substitution of type arguments for type
       parameters generates a type. Dually, we have "existentially quantified"
       (or "existential") type variables: such a type variable denotes some,
       possibly unknown, type. Universal type parameters may specify subtype
       constraints ("bounds"), which must be satisfied by any types they may be
       substituted by. Evaluation of existential types, which involves
       generating fresh type variables, never happens under polymorphic types;
       it is forced only when polymorphic types are applied. *)

    (* annotations *)
    (** A type that annotates a storage location performs two functions:

        * it constrains the types of values stored into the location

        * it masks the actual type of values retrieved from the location, giving
        instead a pro forma type which all such values are considered as having.

        In the former role, the annotated type behaves as an upper bound
        interacting with inflowing lower bounds - these interactions may
        occur e.g. as a result of values being stored to type-annotated
        variables, or arguments flowing to type-annotated parameters.

        In the latter role, the annotated type behaves as a lower bound,
        flowing to sites where values stored in the annotated location are
        used (such as users of a variable, or users of a parameter within
        a function body).

        When a type annotation resolves immediately to a concrete type
        (say, number = NumT or string = StrT), this single type would
        suffice to perform both roles. However, when an annotation has
        not yet been resolved, we can't simply use a type variable as a
        placeholder as we can elsewhere.

        TL;DR type variables are conductors; annotated types are insulators. :)

        For an annotated type, we must collect incoming lower bounds and
        downstream upper bounds without allowing them to interact with each
        other. If we did, the annotation would be "translucent", leaking
        type information about incoming values - failing to perform the
        second of the two roles noted above.

        We accomplish the insulation by wrapping a tvar with AnnotT, and using a
        "slingshot" trick to grab lowers bounds, wait for the wrapped tvar to
        resolve to a type, then release the lower bounds to the resolved
        type. Meanwhile, the tvar itself flows to its upper bounds as usual.

        Note on usage: AnnotT can be used as a general wrapper for tvars as long
        as the wrapped tvars are 0->1. If instead the possible types of a
        wrapped tvar are T1 and T2, then the current rules would flow T1 | T2 to
        upper bounds, and would flow lower bounds to T1 & T2. **)

  (* LookupT is a general-purpose tool for traversing prototype chains in search
     of properties. In all cases, if the property is found somewhere along the
     prototype chain, the property type will unify with the output tvar. Lookup
     kinds control what happens when a property is not found.

   * Strict
     If the property is not found, emit an error. The reason should point to
     the original lookup location.

   * NonstrictReturning None
     If the property is not found, do nothing. Note that lookups of this kind
     will not add any constraints to the output tvar.

   * NonstrictReturning (Some (default, tout))
     If the property is not found, unify a default type with the *original*
     tvar from the lookup.

   * ShadowRead (strict, property_map_ids)
     If the property is not found, installs shadow properties into unsealed
     objects found along the prototype chain.

     Shadow reads can be strict or non-strict, and behaves identically to
     `Strict` and `NonstrictReturning None` respectively.

     Note: Shadow reads are only ever strict in ObjT -> ObjT flows, which
     ensures statements like `var o: { p: T } = {}` are an error. This
     behavior is also race-y, and possibly undesirable.

   * ShadowWrite property_map_ids
     If the property is not found, install a property on a single unsealed
     object type which originated the lookup. Also install shadow properties
     along the prototype chain, to ensure that the entire proto chain is subtype
     compatible. *)
