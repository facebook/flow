(* Some types represent definitions. These include numbers, strings, booleans,
   functions, classes, objects, arrays, and such. The shape of these types
   should be fairly obvious.
   Other types represent uses. These include function applications, class
   instantiations, property accesses, element accesses, operations such as
   addition, predicate refinements, etc. The shape of these types is somewhat
   trickier, but do follow a pattern. Typically, such a type consists of the
   arguments to the operation, and a type variable capturing the result of the
   operation. A full understanding of the semantics of such types requires a
   look at the subtyping relation, described in the module Flow_js. *)

(* Every type has (or should have, if not already) a "reason" for its
   existence. This information is captured in the type itself for now, but
   should be separated out in the future.
   Types that represent definitions point to the positions of such
   definitions (or values). Types that represent uses point to the positions of
   such uses (or operations). These reasons are logged, chained, etc. by the
   implementation of the subtyping algorithm, that effectively constructs a
   proof of the typing derivation based on these reasons as axioms. *)

    (* Usually a type expression is evaluated by splitting it into a def type and
       a use type, and flowing the former to the latter: the def type is the
       "main" argument, and the use type contains the type operation, other
       arguments, and a tvar to hold the result. However, sometimes a type
       expression may need to be kept in explicit form, with the type operation
       and other arguments split out into a "deferred" use type `defer_use_t`,
       whose evaluation state is tracked in the context by an identifier id: When
       defer_use_t is evaluated, id points to a tvar containing the result of
       evaluation. The explicit form simplifies other tasks, like substitution,
       but otherwise works in much the same way as usual. **)

    (** A polymorphic type is like a type-level "function" that, when applied to
        lists of type arguments, generates types. Just like a function, a
        polymorphic type has a list of type parameters, represented as bound type
        variables. We say that type parameters are "universally quantified" (or
        "universal"): every substitution of type arguments for type parameters
        generates a type. Dually, we have "existentially quantified" (or
        "existential") type variables: such a type variable denotes some, possibly
        unknown, type. Universal type parameters may specify subtype constraints
        ("bounds"), which must be satisfied by any types they may be substituted
        by. Evaluation of existential types, which involves generating fresh type
        variables, never happens under polymorphic types; it is forced only when
        polymorphic types are applied. **)

    (* annotations *)
    (**
        A type that annotates a storage location performs two functions:
        * it constrains the types of values stored into the location
        * it masks the actual type of values retrieved from the location,
        giving instead a pro forma type which all such values are
        considered as having.

        In the former role, the annotated type behaves as an upper bound
        interacting with inflowing lower bounds - these interactions may
        occur e.g. as a result of values being stored to type-annotated
        variables, or arguments flowing to type-annotated parameters.

        In the latter role, the annotated type behaves as a lower bound,
        flowing to sites where values stored in the annotated location are
        used (such as users of a variable, or users of a parameter within
        a function body).

        When a type annotation resolves immediately to a concrete type
        (say, number = NumT or string = StrT), this single type would
        suffice to perform both roles. However, when an annotation has
        not yet been resolved, we can't simply use a type variable as a
        placeholder as we can elsewhere.

        TL;DR type variables are conductors; annotated types are insulators. :)

        For an annotated type, we must collect incoming lower bounds and
        downstream upper bounds without allowing them to interact with each
        other. If we did, the annotation would be "translucent", leaking
        type information about incoming values - failing to perform the
        second of the two roles noted above.

        Using a single type variable would allow exactly this propagation:
        it's essentially what type variables do.

        To accomplish the desired insulation we represent an annotation with
        a pair of type variables: a "sink" that collects lower bounds flowing
        into the annotation, and a "source" that collects downstream uses of
        the annotated location as upper bounds.

        The source tvar is linked to the unresolved definition's tvar.
        When that definition is resolved, the concrete type will flow
        into the annotation's source tvar as a lower bound.
        At that point two things will happen:

        * the source tvar will (as usual) evaluate the concrete definition
        against its accumulated upper bounds - this checks downstream use
        sites for compatibility with the annotated type.

        * a UnifyT edge, put in place at the time the AnnotT was built,
        will trigger a unification of the source and sink tvars. Critically,
        this will cause the concrete definition type to appear in the sink
        as an upper bound, prompting the check of all inflowing lower bounds
        against it.

        Of course, inflowing lower bounds and downstream upper bounds may
        continue to accumulate following this unification. As they do,
        they'll be checked against their respective sides of the bonded pair
        as usual.
