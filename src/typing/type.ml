(* Some types represent definitions. These include numbers, strings, booleans,
   functions, classes, objects, arrays, and such. The shape of these types
   should be fairly obvious.
   Other types represent uses. These include function applications, class
   instantiations, property accesses, element accesses, operations such as
   addition, predicate refinements, etc. The shape of these types is somewhat
   trickier, but do follow a pattern. Typically, such a type consists of the
   arguments to the operation, and a type variable capturing the result of the
   operation. A full understanding of the semantics of such types requires a
   look at the subtyping relation, described in the module Flow_js. *)

(* Every type has (or should have, if not already) a "reason" for its
   existence. This information is captured in the type itself for now, but
   should be separated out in the future.
   Types that represent definitions point to the positions of such
   definitions (or values). Types that represent uses point to the positions of
   such uses (or operations). These reasons are logged, chained, etc. by the
   implementation of the subtyping algorithm, that effectively constructs a
   proof of the typing derivation based on these reasons as axioms. *)

       into a context's graph: a context's graph is a map from tvar ids to nodes
       (see below).

       Note: ids are globally unique. tvars are "owned" by a single context,
       but that context and its tvars may later be merged into other contexts.

    (* type expression whose evaluation is deferred *)
    (* Usually a type expression is evaluated by splitting it into a def type
       and a use type, and flowing the former to the latter: the def type is the
       "main" argument, and the use type contains the type operation, other
       arguments, and a tvar to hold the result. However, sometimes a type
       expression may need to be kept in explicit form, with the type operation
       and other arguments split out into a "deferred" use type `defer_use_t`,
       whose evaluation state is tracked in the context by an identifier id:
       When defer_use_t is evaluated, id points to a tvar containing the result
       of evaluation. The explicit form simplifies other tasks, like
       substitution, but otherwise works in much the same way as usual. *)

    (* annotations *)
    (* A type that annotates a storage location performs two functions:

     * it constrains the types of values stored into the location

     * it masks the actual type of values retrieved from the location, giving
       instead a pro forma type which all such values are considered as having.

       In the former role, the annotated type behaves as an upper bound
       interacting with inflowing lower bounds - these interactions may
       occur e.g. as a result of values being stored to type-annotated
       variables, or arguments flowing to type-annotated parameters.

       In the latter role, the annotated type behaves as a lower bound,
       flowing to sites where values stored in the annotated location are
       used (such as users of a variable, or users of a parameter within
       a function body).

       When a type annotation resolves immediately to a concrete type
       (say, number = NumT or string = StrT), this single type would
       suffice to perform both roles. However, when an annotation has
       not yet been resolved, we can't simply use a type variable as a
       placeholder as we can elsewhere.

       TL;DR type variables are conductors; annotated types are insulators. :)

       For an annotated type, we must collect incoming lower bounds and
       downstream upper bounds without allowing them to interact with each
       other. If we did, the annotation would be "translucent", leaking
       type information about incoming values - failing to perform the
       second of the two roles noted above.

       We accomplish the insulation by wrapping a tvar with AnnotT, and using a
       "slingshot" trick to grab lowers bounds, wait for the wrapped tvar to
       resolve to a type, then release the lower bounds to the resolved
       type. Meanwhile, the tvar itself flows to its upper bounds as usual.

       Note on usage: AnnotT can be used as a general wrapper for tvars as long
       as the wrapped tvars are 0->1. If instead the possible types of a
       wrapped tvar are T1 and T2, then the current rules would flow T1 | T2 to
       upper bounds, and would flow lower bounds to T1 & T2. **)

                                  polymorphic type has a list of type parameters, represented as bound
                                  type variables. We say that type parameters are "universally quantified"
                                  (or "universal"): every substitution of type arguments for type
                                  parameters generates a type. Dually, we have "existentially quantified"
                                  (or "existential") type variables: such a type variable denotes some,
                                  possibly unknown, type. Universal type parameters may specify subtype
                                  constraints ("bounds"), which must be satisfied by any types they may be
                                  substituted by. Evaluation of existential types, which involves
                                  generating fresh type variables, never happens under polymorphic types;

     * predicates are "open", in the sense that they have free occurrences of
     * each function's formal parameters (xs and xs', respectively).
     *
     * The constraint T <: T', causes the following (expected) sub-constraints:

     *  - Ts' <: Ts
     *  - R <: R'

  (*
     Terminology:

      * A step records a single test of lower bound against
      upper bound, analogous to an invocation of the flow function.

      * A step may have a tvar as its lower or upper bound (or both).
      tvars act as conduits for concrete types, so steps which
      begin or end in tvars may be joined with other steps
      representing tests which adjoin the same tvar.

      The resulting sequence of steps, corresponding to an invocation
      of the flow function followed by the extension of the original
      lower/upper pair through any adjacent type variables, forms the
      basis of a trace. (In trace dumps this is called a "path".)

      * When a step has been induced recursively from a prior invocation
      of the flow function, it's said to have the trace associated with
      that invocation as a parent.

      (Note that each step in a path may have its own parent: consider
      an incoming, recursively induced step joining with a dormant step
      attached to some tvar in an arbitrarily removed invocation of the
      flow function.)

      * A trace is just a sequence of steps along with a (possibly empty)
      parent trace for each step. Since steps may share parents,
      a trace forms a graph, though it is naturally built up as a tree
      when recorded during evaluation of the flow function.
      (The formatting we do in reasons_of_trace recovers the graph
      structure for readability.)

     the longest ancestor chain in the trace. We keep this precomputed because

     a) actual ancestors may be thrown away due to externally imposed limits on trace
        depth;

     b) the recursion limiter in the flow function checks this on every call.

      - A Resolved constraint contains a concrete type that is considered by the
        type system to be the solution of the tvar carrying the constraint. In other
        words, the tvar is equivalent to this concrete type in all respects.

      unresolved tvar.

      - upper and lower hold concrete upper and lower bounds, respectively. At any
        point in analysis the aggregate lower bound of a tvar is (conceptually) the
        union of the concrete types in lower, and the aggregate upper bound is
        (conceptually) the intersection of the concrete types in upper. (Upper and
        lower are maps, with the types as keys, and trace information as values.)

      - lowertvars and uppertvars hold tvars which are also (latent) lower and
        upper bounds, respectively. See the __flow function for how these structures
        are populated and operated on.  Here the map keys are tvar ids, with trace
        info as values.

      The use_op in the lower TypeMap represents the use_op when a lower bound
