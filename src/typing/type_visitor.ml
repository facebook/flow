(* We walk types in a lot of places for all kinds of things, but often most of
   the code is boilerplate. The following visitor class for types aims to
   reduce that boilerplate. It is designed as a fold on the structure of types,
   parameterized by an accumulator.

   WARNING: This is only a partial implementation, sufficient for current
   purposes but intended to be completed in a later diff.
