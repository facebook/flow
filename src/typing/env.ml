(* lookup modes:

   - ForValue is a lookup from a syntactic value location, i.e. standard
     JS code

   - ForType is a lookup from a syntactic type location, e.g. annotations,
     interface declarations etc.

   - ForTypeof is a lookup from a typeof expression (necessarily in a type
     location)

   Rules:

   1. ForValue lookups give errors if they retrieve type aliases (note: we
      have a single namespace, so any name resolves uniquely to either a
      value or type)

   2. ForValue lookups give errors if they forward reference non-hoisted
      things (lets or consts)

   3. ForType lookups may return values or type aliases, since some values
      also denote types - e.g. a generator function F also denotes the type
      of the objects it creates. Of course many values don't also have a type
      denotation and thus errors in type position. But we don't know the type
      of a symbol during local inference as a rule, so errors of this kind are
      not raised here.

   4. ForTypeof lookups are in fact ForValue lookups, but due to the order in
      which AST traversal takes place, these lookups may legitimately violate
      rule #2, hence the need for a special mode.

(* any names that haven't been resolved in upper scopes
   wind up here. after handling special names, we add a Var
   binding to the local scope, and register a lookup with
   the global builtin type, to be resolved later.

   Of course, the globals being referred to may not be vars:
   they may instead be consts or type aliases. Currently we
   have no process for checking the use of a global binding
   against the kind of binding it turns out to be: this global
   scope is simply a proxy; resolution takes place as a result
   of the GetPropT types created in the call to Flow.get_builtin.

   This means that we have some false negatives, currently.
   Errors that go unreported currently include:
   - type aliases referred to from value positions
   - global consts assigned to locally
   The first is especially problematic, since it will actually
   cause a runtime error.

   The least complex solution to this will be to process libs
   eagerly, and save the actual scope to check against here
   when doing local checking of modules. Alternatively, we
   would have to record in the GetPropT (or an enrichment) enough
   information about what uses were made of the reference to
   flag such errors on the current deferred basis.
   tests/global_ref tracks this issue.
