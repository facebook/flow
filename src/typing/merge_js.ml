(* Merge a component with its "implicit requires" and "explicit requires." The
   implicit requires are those defined in libraries. For the explicit
   requires, we need to merge only those parts of the dependency graph that the
   component immediately depends on. (We assume that this merging is part of a
   recursive process that has already handled recursive dependencies.)

   Now, by definition, files in a component can bidirectionally depend only on
   other files in the component. All other dependencies are unidirectional.

   Let dep_cxs contain the (optimized) contexts of all dependencies that are
   unidirectional, and let component_cxs contain the contexts of the files in
   the component. Let master_cx be the (optimized) context of libraries.

   Let implementations contain the dependency edges between contexts in
   component_cxs and dep_cxs, resources contain the dependency edges between
   contexts in component_cxs and resource files, and declarations contain the
   dependency edges from component_cxs to master_cx.

   We assume that the first context in component_cxs is that of the leader (cx):
   this serves as the "host" for the merging. Let the remaining contexts in
   component_cxs be other_cxs.

   1. Copy dep_cxs, other_cxs, and master_cx to the host cx.

   2. Link the edges in implementations.

   3. Link the edges in resources.

   4. Link the edges in declarations.

   5. Link the local references to libraries in master_cx and component_cxs.

(* After merging dependencies into a context (but before optimizing the
   context), it is important to restore the parts of the context that were
   copied from other, already optimized contexts (dep_cxs and master_cx, see
   above comment for details on what they mean). Indeed, merging is an
   imperative process, and there is no guarantee that those parts of the context
   would have remained unchanged.

   Restoration maintains consistency for "diamond-shaped" dependency relations:
   it forces two contexts B and C that depend on the same context A to agree on
   the meaning of the parts of A they share (and that meaning is dictated by A
   itself), and so some context D that depends on both B and C (and perhaps A
   too) is never confused when merging them.

(* Given a sig context, it makes sense to clear the parts that are shared with
   the master sig context. Why? The master sig context, which contains global
   declarations, is an implicit dependency for every file, and so will be
   "merged in" anyway, thus making those shared parts redundant to carry around
   in other sig contexts. This saves a lot of shared memory as well as
   deserialization time. *)

(****************** signature contexts *********************)

(* Once a context is merged with other contexts it depends on, it is ready to be
   optimized for use by contexts that in turn depend on it. The only interesting
   part of the context for such use is its exports. Thus, we call a context
   optimized for such use a "signature context."

   A signature context should contain only descriptions of its exports. Anything
   that does not contribute to those descriptions are redundant and should be
   discarded: otherwise, we would end up paying significant hidden costs, in
   terms of memory (storing in the heap) and time (serializing / deserializing
   from the heap, garbage collection pauses).

   As it turns out, it is not always possible or even desirable to describe the
   exports in "closed form" as types: instead, the descriptions take the form of
   a (mutually) recursive system of "equations" relating type variables to
   "solved" types, and the types themselves may contain these type variables
   inside. As indicated above, such descriptions are both necessary (due to
   recursive types) and desirable (due to sharing, and for cyclically depending
   contexts, due to the need to deal with the exports of all such contexts at
   once). This form is quite adequate for type checking (indeed, it can be
   thought of as merely a condensed form of usual contexts, which already
   exhibit this "interlinked" behavior).

   Unsurprisingly, since types also make references to some other maps in a
   context (property maps, envs), these references need to be carried around
   as well for the descriptions to be complete.

   We can collect compact and complete descriptions of exports by using a custom
   type visitor that marks relevant things that need to be carried over as it
   walks the context from its exports. Once the walk is done, we can replace the
   corresponding parts of the context (graph, property maps, envs) by their
   reduced forms.
