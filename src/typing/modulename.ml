(* Signature for module names. Such names are assumed to be "resolved", and have
   global scope in the sense that they may be used to identify modules uniquely
   in a code base. In contrast, module references (strings that are used to
   refer to modules in require/import statements) have local scope in the sense
   that their meaning is relative to the files they appear in.

   There are two ways to construct a module name:

   * A module name may be a String that is declared in a file: e.g., in the
   Haste module system such module names are declared via @providesModule.

   * A module name may be a Filename: e.g., in the Node module system a module
   is simply known by its path in the file system.
