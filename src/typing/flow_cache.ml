(* Cache that limits instantiation of polymorphic definitions. Intuitively,
   for each operation on a polymorphic definition, we remember the type
   arguments we use to specialize the type parameters. An operation is
   identified by its reason, and possibly the reasons of its arguments. We
   don't use the entire operation for caching since it may contain the very
   type variables we are trying to limit the creation of with the cache (e.g.,
   those representing the result): the cache would be useless if we considered
   those type variables as part of the identity of the operation. *)
