 * Before running inference, we assume that we're dealing with a CommonJS
 * module that has a built-in, initialized `exports` object (i.e. it is not an
 * ES module).
 *
 * During inference, if we encounter an assignment to module.exports then we
 * use this as an indicator that the module is definitely a CommonJS module --
 * but that the bult-in `exports` value is no longer the exported variable.
 * Instead, whatever was assigned to `module.exports` is now that CJS exported
 * value.
 *
 * On the other hand, if we encounter an ES `export` statement during inference,
 * we use this as an indicator that the module is an ES module. The one
 * exception to this rule is that we do not use `export type` as an indicator of
 * an ES module (since we want CommonJS modules to be able to use `export type`
 * as well).
 *
 * At the end of inference, we make use of this information to decide which
 * types to store as the expors of the module (i.e. Do we use the built-in
 * `exports` value? Do we use the type that clobbered `module.exports`? Or do we
 * use neither because the module only has direct ES exports?).

(* Module exports are treated differently than `exports`. The latter is a
   variable that is implicitly set to the empty object at the top of a
   module. As such, properties can be added to it throughout the module,
   corresponding to the pattern exports.foo = ... for exporting foo. As it turns
   out, module.exports is the same object. A different pattern is to reset
   module.exports at the end of the module, like module.exports = { foo: ... }
   to export foo. This makes any properties added to the exports object
   redundant. Both these patterns are modeled by storing module.exports as an
   internal variable, initially set to the empty object, doing inference on a
   module, and then flowing module.exports to exports, so that whatever its
   final value is (initial object or otherwise) is checked against the type
   declared for exports or any other use of exports. *)
