  (** Entry points into the process of trying different branches of union and
      intersection types.

     The problem we're trying to solve here is common to checking unions and
     intersections: how do we make a choice between alternatives, when (i) we have
     only partial information (i.e., while we're in the middle of type inference)
     and when (ii) we want to avoid regret (i.e., by not committing to an
     alternative that might not work out, when alternatives that were not
     considered could have worked out)?

     To appreciate the problem, consider what happens without choice. Partial
     information is not a problem: we emit constraints that must be satisfied for
     something to work, and either those constraints fail (indicating a problem)
     or they don't fail (indicating no problem). With choice and partial
     information, we cannot naively emit constraints as we try alternatives
     *without also having a mechanism to roll back those constraints*. This is
     because those constraints don't *have* to be satisfied; some other
     alternative may end up not needing those constraints to be satisfied for
     things to work out!

     It is not too hard to imagine scary scenarios we can get into without a
     roll-back mechanism. (These scenarios are not theoretical, by the way: with a
     previous implementation of union and intersection types that didn't
     anticipate these scenarios, they consistently caused a lot of problems in
     real-world use cases.)

     * One bad state we can get into is where, when trying an alternative, we emit
     constraints hoping they would be satisfied, and they appear to work. So we
     commit to that particular alternative. Then much later find out that those
     constraints are unsatified, at which point we have lost the ability to try
     other alternatives that could have worked. This leads to a class of bugs
     where a union or intersection type contains cases that should have worked,
     but they don't.

     * An even worse state we can get into is where we do discover that an
     alternative won't work out while we're still in a position of choosing
     another alternative, but in the process of making that discovery we emit
     constraints that linger on in a ghost-like state. Meanwhile, we pick another
     alternative, it works out, and we move on. Except that much later the ghost
     constraints become unsatisfied, leading to much confusion on the source of
     the resulting errors. This leads to a class of bugs where we get spurious
     errors even when a union or intersection type seems to have worked.

     So, we just implement roll-back, right? Basically...yes. But rolling back
     constraints is really hard in the current implementation. Instead, we try to
     avoid processing constraints that have side effects as much as possible while
     trying alternatives: by ensuring that (1) we don't (need to) emit too many
     constraints that have side effects (2) those that we do emit get deferred,
     instead of being processed immediately, until a choice can be made, thereby
     not participating in the choice-making process.

     (1) How do we ensure we don't emit too many constraints that have side
     effects? By fully resolving types before they participate in the
     choice-making process. Basically, we want to have as much information as we
     can before trying alternatives. It is a nice property of our implementation
     that once types are resolved, constraints emitted against them don't have
     (serious) side effects: they get simplified and simplified until we either
     hit success or failure. The details of this process is described in
     ResolvableTypeJob and in resolve_bindings.

     (2) But not all types can be fully resolved. In particular, while union and
     intersection types themselves can be fully resolved, the lower and upper
     bounds we check them against could have still-to-be-inferred types in
     them. How do we ensure that for the potentially side-effectful constraints we
     do emit on these types, we avoid undue side effects? By explicitly marking
     these types as unresolved, and deferring the execution of constraints that
     involved such marked types until a choice can be made. The details of this
     process is described in Speculation.

     There is a necessary trade-off in the approach. In particular, (2) means that
     sometimes choices cannot be made: it is ambiguous which constraints should be
     executed when trying different alternatives. We detect such ambiguities
     (conservatively, but only when a best-effort choice-making strategy doesn't
     work), and ask for additional annotations to disambiguate the relevant
     alternatives. A particularly nice property of this approach is that it is
     complete: with enough annotations it is always possible to make a
     choice. Another "meta-feature" of this approach is that it leaves room for
     incremental improvement: e.g., we would need fewer additional annotations as
     we improve our inference algorithm to detect cases where more unresolved
     tvars can be fully resolved ahead of time (in other words, detect when they
     have the "0->1" property, discussed elsewhere, roughly meaning they are
     determined by annotations).

    (* Preprocessing for intersection types.

       Before feeding into the choice-making machinery described above, we
       preprocess upper bounds of intersection types. This preprocessing seems
       asymmetric, but paradoxically, it is not: the purpose of the preprocessing is
       to bring choice-making on intersections to parity with choice-making on
       unions.

       Consider what happens when a lower bound is checked against a union type. The
       lower bound is always concretized before a choice is made! In other words,
       even if we emit a flow from an unresolved tvar to a union type, the
       constraint fires only when the unresolved tvar has been concretized.

       Now, consider checking an intersection type with an upper bound. As an
       artifact of how tvars and concrete types are processed, the upper bound would
       appear to be concrete even though the actual parts of the upper bound that
       are involved in the choice-making may be unresolved! (These parts are the
       top-level input positions in the upper bound, which end up choosing between
       the top-level input positions in the members of the intersection type.) If we
       did not concretize the parts of the upper bound involved in choice-making, we
       would start the choice-making process at a disadvantage (compared to
       choice-making with a union type and an already concretized lower
       bound). Thus, we do an extra preprocessing step where we collect the parts of
       the upper bound to be concretized, and for each combination of concrete types
       for those parts, call the choice-making process.
    *)

  (** The following function concretizes each tvar in unresolved in turn,
      recording their corresponding concrete lower bounds in resolved as it
      goes. At each step, it emits a ConcretizeTypes constraint on an unresolved
      tvar, which in turn calls into this function when a concrete lower bound
      appears on that tvar. **)

  (* Here we continue where we left off at ResolvableTypeJob. Once we have
     collected a set of type resolution jobs, we create so-called bindings from
     these jobs. A binding is a (id, tvar) pair, where tvar is what needs to be
     resolved, and id is an identifier that serves as an index for that job.

     We don't try to fully resolve unresolved tvars that are not annotation
     sources or heads of type applications, since in general they don't satify the
     0->1 property. Instead:

     (1) When we're expecting them, e.g., when we're looking at inferred types, we
     mark them so that we can recognize them later, during speculative matching.

     (2) When we're not expecting them, e.g., when we're fully resolving union /
     intersection type annotations, we unify them as `any`. Ideally we wouldn't be
     worrying about this case, but who knows what cruft we might have accumulated
     on annotation types, so just getting that cruft out of the way.

     These decisions were made in ResolvableTypeJob.collect_of_types and are
     reflected in the use (or not) of OpenUnresolved (see below).

  (* Let id be the identifier associated with a tvar that is not yet
     resolved. (Here, resolved/unresolved refer to the state of the tvar in the
     context graph: does it point to Resolved _ or Unresolved _?) As soon as the
     tvar is resolved to some type, we generate some bindings by walking that
     type. Full type resolution at id now depends on full resolution of the
     ids/tvars in those bindings. The following function ensures that those
     dependencies are recorded and processed.

     Dependency management happens in Graph_explorer, using efficient data
     structures discussed therein. All we need to do here is to connect id to
     bindings in that graph, while taking care that (1) the conditions of adding
     edges to the graph are satisfied, and (2) cleaning up the effects of adding
     those edges to the graph. Finally (3) we request full type resolution of the
     bindings themselves.

     For (1), note that the graph only retains transitively closed dependencies
     from one kind of tvars to another kind of tvars. The former kind includes
     tvars that are resolved but not yet fully resolved. The latter kind includes
     tvars that are not yet resolved. Thus, in particular we must filter out
     bindings that correspond to fully resolved tvars (see
     is_unfinished_target). On the other hand, the fully_resolve_type function
     below already ensures that id is not yet fully resolved (via
     is_unexplored_source).

     For (2), after adding edges we might discover that some tvars are now fully
     resolved: this happens when, e.g., no new transitively closed dependencies
     get added on id, and full type resolution of some tvars depended only on id.
     If any of these fully resolved tvars were goal tvars, we trigger them.

     For (3) we emit a ResolveType constraint for each binding; when the
     corresponding tvar is resolved, the function fully_resolve_type below is
     called, which in turn calls back into this function (thus closing the
     recursive loop).

  (* Speculatively match several alternatives in turn, as presented when checking
     a union or intersection type. This process maintains a so-called "match
     state" that describes the best possible choice found so far, and can
     terminate in various ways:

     (1) One of the alternatives definitely succeeds. This is straightforward: we
     can safely discard any later alternatives.

     (2) All alternatives fail. This is also straightforward: we emit an
     appropriate error message.

     (3) One of the alternatives looks promising (i.e., it doesn't immediately
     fail, but it doesn't immediately succeed either: some potentially
     side-effectful constraints, called actions, were emitted while trying the
     alternative, whose execution has been deferred), and all the later
     alternatives fail. In this scenario, we pick the promising alternative, and
     then fire the deferred actions. This is fine, because the choice cannot cause
     regret: the chosen alternative was the only one that had any chance of
     succeeding.

     (4) Multiple alternatives look promising, but the set of deferred actions
     emitted while trying the first of those alternatives form a subset of those
     emitted by later trials. Here we pick the first promising alternative (and
     fire the deferred actions). The reason this is fine is similar to (3): once
     again, the choice cannot cause any regret, because if it failed, then the
     later alternatives would have failed too. So the chosen alternative had the
     best chance of succeeding.

     (5) But sometimes, multiple alternatives look promising and we really can't
     decide which is best. This happens when the set of deferred actions emitted
     by them are incomparable, or later trials have more chances of succeeding
     than previous trials. Such scenarios typically point to real ambiguities, and
     so we ask for additional annotations on unresolved tvars to disambiguate.

     See Speculation for more details on terminology and low-level mechanisms used
     here, including what bits of information are carried by match_state and case,
     how actions are deferred and diff'd, etc.

     Because this process is common to checking union and intersection types, we
     abstract the latter into a so-called "spec." The spec is used to customize
     error messages and to ignore unresolved tvars that are deemed irrelevant to
     choice-making.

  (* spec optimization *)

     When a literal type is checked against a union of literal types, we hope the union is an enum and
     try to optimize the representation of the union as such. We also try to use our optimization to
     do a quick membership check, potentially avoiding the speculative matching process altogether.

     When an object type is checked against an union of object types, we hope the union is a disjoint
     union and try to guess and record sentinel properties across object types in the union. Later,
     during speculative matching, by checking sentinel properties first we force immediate match
     failures in the vast majority of cases without having to do any useless additional work.
