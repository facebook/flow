  (** Entry points into the process of trying different branches of union and
      intersection types.

     The problem we're trying to solve here is common to checking unions and
     intersections: how do we make a choice between alternatives, when we want
     to avoid regret (i.e., by not committing to an alternative that might not
     work out, when alternatives that were not considered could have worked out)?

     To appreciate the problem, consider what happens without choice. Partial
     information is not a problem: we emit constraints that must be satisfied for
     something to work, and either those constraints fail (indicating a problem)
     or they don't fail (indicating no problem). With choice we cannot naively
     emit constraints as we try alternatives *without also having a mechanism to
     roll back those constraints*. This is because those constraints don't *have*
     to be satisfied; some other alternative may end up not needing those
     constraints to be satisfied for things to work out!

     It is not too hard to imagine scary scenarios we can get into without a
     roll-back mechanism. (These scenarios are not theoretical, by the way: with a
     previous implementation of union and intersection types that didn't
     anticipate these scenarios, they consistently caused a lot of problems in
     real-world use cases.)

     * One bad state we can get into is where, when trying an alternative, we emit
     constraints hoping they would be satisfied, and they appear to work. So we
     commit to that particular alternative. Then much later find out that those
     constraints are unsatified, at which point we have lost the ability to try
     other alternatives that could have worked. This leads to a class of bugs
     where a union or intersection type contains cases that should have worked,
     but they don't.

     * An even worse state we can get into is where we do discover that an
     alternative won't work out while we're still in a position of choosing
     another alternative, but in the process of making that discovery we emit
     constraints that linger on in a ghost-like state. Meanwhile, we pick another
     alternative, it works out, and we move on. Except that much later the ghost
     constraints become unsatisfied, leading to much confusion on the source of
     the resulting errors. This leads to a class of bugs where we get spurious
     errors even when a union or intersection type seems to have worked.

     So, we just implement roll-back, right? Basically...yes. But rolling back
     constraints is really hard in the current implementation. Instead, we try to
     avoid processing constraints that have side effects as much as possible while
     trying alternatives: by ensuring that the constraints that have side effects
     get deferred, instead of being processed immediately, until a choice can be
     made, thereby not participating in the choice-making process.

     But not all types can be fully resolved. In particular, while union and
     intersection types themselves can be fully resolved, the lower and upper
     bounds we check them against could have still-to-be-inferred types in
     them. How do we ensure that for the potentially side-effectful constraints we
     do emit on these types, we avoid undue side effects? By explicitly marking
     these types as unresolved, and deferring the execution of constraints that
     involved such marked types until a choice can be made. The details of this
     process is described in Speculation.
  *)

  (* Every choice-making process on a union or intersection type is assigned a
     unique identifier, called the speculation_id. This identifier keeps track of
     unresolved tvars encountered when trying to fully resolve types. *)

     particular "branch": this context controls how some constraints emitted
     during the matching might be processed. See comments in Speculation for
     details on branches. See also speculative_matches, which calls this function
     iteratively and processes its results. *)

  (* Speculatively match several alternatives in turn, as presented when checking
     a union or intersection type. This process can terminate in various ways:

     (1) One of the alternatives definitely succeeds. This is straightforward: we
     can safely discard any later alternatives.

     (2) All alternatives fail. This is also straightforward: we emit an
     appropriate error message.

     See Speculation for more details on terminology and low-level mechanisms used
     here, including what bits of information are carried by case.

     Because this process is common to checking union and intersection types, we
     abstract the latter into a so-called "spec." The spec is used to customize
     error messages.

     do a quick membership check, potentially avoiding the speculative matching process altogether.

     When an object type is checked against an union of object types, we hope the union is a disjoint
     union and try to guess and record sentinel properties across object types in the union. Later,
