(* Destructuring visitor for tree-shaped patterns, parameteric over an action f
   to perform at the leaves. A type for the pattern is passed, which is taken
   apart as the visitor goes deeper. *)

(** NOTE: Since the type of the pattern may contain (unsubstituted) type
    parameters, it is important that this visitor does not emit constraints:
    otherwise, we may end up with (unsubstituted) type parameters appearing as
    lower or upper bounds of constraints, which would violate a core
    invariant. So, instead we model the operation of destructuring with a
    wrapper constructor, `DestructuringT` (with lazy evaluation rules that
    trigger whenever a result is needed, e.g., to interact in flows with other
    lower and upper bounds). **)
