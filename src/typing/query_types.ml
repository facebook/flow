(* Query/Suggest *)
(*****************)

(* These computations should trigger ground_type calls on the types returned by
   query_type/suggest_types: in general those types may not be ground (the only
   non-ground parts should be strict_requires).

   1. Look up ResolvedRequiresHeap(Context.file cx) to get strict_reqs.

   2. Look up ContextHeap(NameHeap(strict_req)) to get strict_cxs that cx
   depends on, and so on.

   3. Next, look up their exported types via recursive calls to
   lookup_type(lookup_module(strict_cx, Context.module_name strict_cx)).

   In fact, 2. and 3. could be optimized: we could store exported types
   (possibly not ground) in InfoHeap, so that they are cached. This means that
   we could look up InfoHeap(NameHeap(strict_req)) to get strict_req_types
   directly, instead of going through ContextHeap.

   Note that exported types do not need to be blown away unless their files
   change, since they are locally determined; instead, we ground them as
   necessary.

(* 'suggest' can use as many types in the type tables as possible, which is why
   we are querying the tables from both "coverage" and "type_info". Coverage
   should be enough on its own, but "type_info" stores method types more
   reliably. On the other hand "type_info" only stores information about
   identifiers, so anonymous functions and arrows are not captured.
