(*
   Terminology:

    * A step records a single test of lower bound against
    upper bound, analogous to an invocation of the flow function.

    * A step may have a tvar as its lower or upper bound (or both).
    tvars act as conduits for concrete types, so steps which
    begin or end in tvars may be joined with other steps
    representing tests which adjoin the same tvar.

    The resulting sequence of steps, corresponding to an invocation
    of the flow function followed by the extension of the original
    lower/upper pair through any adjacent type variables, forms the
    basis of a trace. (In trace dumps this is called a "path".)

    * When a step has been induced recursively from a prior invocation
    of the flow function, it's said to have the trace associated with
    that invocation as a parent.

    (Note that each step in a path may have its own parent: consider
    an incoming, recursively induced step joining with a dormant step
    attached to some tvar in an arbitrarily removed invocation of the
    flow function.)

    * A trace is just a sequence of steps along with a (possibly empty)
    parent trace for each step. Since steps may share parents,
    a trace forms a graph, though it is naturally built up as a tree
    when recorded during evaluation of the flow function.
    (The formatting we do in reasons_of_trace recovers the graph
    structure for readability.)
*)
type step =
  | Step of {
      lower: Type.t;
      upper: Type.use_t;
      parent: step list;
    }

(* A list of steps and the depth of the trace, trace depth is 1 + the length of
   the longest ancestor chain in the trace. We keep this precomputed because

   a) actual ancestors may be thrown away due to externally imposed limits on trace
      depth;

   b) the recursion limiter in the flow function checks this on every call.
