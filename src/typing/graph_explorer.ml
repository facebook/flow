(* Custom efficient graph data structure to track exploration of a graph, as
   nodes and edges are dynamically discovered.

   The primary purpose of the data structure is to immediately detect any node
   that is "fully explored", meaning that all nodes that are transitively
   reachable from it have been explored. As long as some of the nodes that are
   reachable from a node have not been explored yet, the node is not fully
   explored.

   A key assumption about the graph is that every node has the following "0->1"
   property: it transitions in one step from a state where it has been
   discovered (the "0" state) to a step where it has been explored (the "1"
   state), i.e., all of its immediate outgoing edges are added at once.

   Certain tvars in Flow have the "0->1" property in the following sense: they
   transition from unresolved to resolved in one step. We can therefore use the
   data structure here to efficiently manage full resolution for such tvars.

   NOTE: This data structure is not guaranteed to work as intended if we try to
   resolve an already resolved tvar, or never resolve an unresolved
   tvar. Roughly, a tvar can be considered to have the 0->1 property whenever it
   is guaranteed to receive one and only one lower bound over its lifetime.
*)

(* The graph maintains the two sets of nodes separately, with edges going across
   in both directions. In other words, the graph is bipartite.

   There are two kinds of nodes: unexplored and explored. Explored nodes have
   dependencies to unexplored nodes. Unexplored nodes have reverse dependencies
   to explored nodes. Note that we always maintain dependencies (and reverse
   dependencies) in transitively closed form.

   Logically these sets are disjoint. As explained above, each node starts out
   as unexplored, and becomes explored when a set of edges are introduced from
   the node to other nodes.

(** NOTE: This process has a lot of similarities with how constraints on usual
    tvars are handled in the context graph. In the future, we might move this
    processing back into that framework, by introducing new kinds of tvars on
