(* This module describes the subtyping algorithm that forms the core of
   typechecking. The algorithm (in its basic form) is described in Francois
   Pottier's thesis. The main data structures maintained by the algorithm are:
   (1) for every type variable, which type variables form its lower and upper
   bounds (i.e., flow in and out of the type variable); and (2) for every type
   variable, which concrete types form its lower and upper bounds. Every new
   subtyping constraint added to the system is deconstructed into its subparts,
   until basic flows between type variables and other type variables or concrete
   types remain; these flows are then viewed as links in a chain, bringing
   together further concrete types and type variables to participate in
   subtyping. This process continues till a fixpoint is reached---which itself
   is guaranteed to exist, and is usually reached in very few steps. *)

(* The following functions are used as constructors for function types and
   object types, which unfortunately have many fields, not all of which are
   meaningful in all contexts. This part of the design should be revisited:
   perhaps the data types can be refactored to make them more specialized. *)

   want to encourage this pattern, but we also don't want to block uses of this
   pattern. Thus, we compromise by not tracking the property types. *)

(* An object type has two flags, sealed and exact. A sealed object type cannot

   properties, the object type must be exact. Thus, as an invariant, "not exact"
   logically implies "sealed" (and by contrapositive, "not sealed" implies
   "exact"; in other words, exact and sealed cannot both be false).

   Types of object literals are exact, but can be sealed or unsealed. Object
   type annotations are sealed but not exact. *)

   - each scope has an id. scope ids are unique, mod cloning

   - an environment is a scope list
   - each context holds a map of environment snapshots, keyed

   - every function type contains a frame id, which maps to
   the environment in which it was defined; as well as a
   changeset containing its reads/writes/refinements on
   closed-over variables

   Given frame ids for calling function and called function and
   the changeset of the called function, here we retrieve the
   environment snapshots for the two functions, find the prefix
   of scopes they share, and havoc the variables in the called
   function's write set which live in those scopes.

(** The following functions do "shallow" walks over types, respectively from
    requires and from exports, in order to report missing annotations. There are
    some opportunities for future work:

    - Rewrite these functions using a type visitor class.

    - Consider using gc to crawl the graph further down from requires, and
    maybe also up from exports. Preliminary experiments along those lines
    suggest that a general walk doesn't always give expected results. As an
    example in one direction, the signature of a class is reachable from a
    `require`d superclass, but the corresponding constraint simply checks for
    consistency of overrides, and should not relax reporting missing annotations
    in the signature. As an example in the other direction, an exported function
    may have an open `this` type that we cannot expect to be annotated.

    (* Sometimes a polymorphic class may have a polymorphic method whose return

       expanded. See Array#map or Array#concat, e.g. It is not unusual for
       programmers to reuse variables, assigning the result of a method call on
       a variable to itself, in which case we could get into cycles of unbounded
       instantiation. We use caching to cut these cycles. Caching relies on
       reasons (see module Cache.I). This is OK since intuitively, there should
       be a unique instantiation of a polymorphic definition for any given use
       of it in the source code.

       In principle we could use caching more liberally, but we don't because
       not all use types arise from source code, and because reasons are not
       perfect. Indeed, if we tried caching for all use types, we'd lose
       precision and report spurious errors.

       Also worth noting is that we can never safely cache def types. This is
       because substitution of type parameters in def types does not affect
       their reasons, so we'd trivially lose precision. *)

    (* Singletons and keys *)
    (***********************)

    (** Finite keysets over arbitrary objects can be represented by KeysT. While
        it is possible to also represent singleton string types using KeysT (by
        taking the keyset of an object with a single property whose key is that
        string and whose value is ignored), we can model them more directly
        using SingletonStrT. Specifically, SingletonStrT models a type
        annotation that looks like a string literal, which describes a singleton
        set containing that string literal. Going further, other uses of KeysT
        where the underlying object is created solely for the purpose of
        describing a keyset can be modeled using unions of singleton strings.

        One may also legitimately wonder why SingletonStrT(_, key) cannot be
        always replaced by StrT(_, Some key). The reason is that types of the
        latter form (string literal types) are inferred to be the type of string
        literals appearing as values, and we don't want to prematurely narrow
        down the type of the location where such values may appear, since that
        would preclude other strings to be stored in that location. Thus, by
        necessity we allow all string types to flow to StrT (whereas only
        exactly matching string literal types may flow to SingletonStrT).  **)

       that T is a subtype of T' for any X:U'. A more general rule that proves
       that U' is a subtype of U instead of forcing U = U' is known to cause
       undecidable subtyping (Pierce): the counterexamples are fairly
       pathological, but can be reliably constructed by exploiting the "switch"
       of bounds from U' to U (and back, with sufficient trickery), in ways that
       are difficult to detect statically.

       However, these results are somewhat tricky to interpret in Flow, since we
       are not proving stuff inductively: instead we are co-inductively assuming
       what we want to prove, and checking consistency.

       Separately, none of these rules capture the logical interpretation of the
       original subtyping question (interpreting subtyping as implication, and
       polymorphism as universal quantification). What we really want to show is
       that, for all X:U', there is some X:U such that T is a subtype of T'. But
       we already deal with statements of this form when checking polymorphic
       definitions! In particular, statements such as "there is some X:U...")
       correspond to "create a type variable with that constraint and ...", and
       statements such as "show that for all X:U" correspond to "show that for
       both X = bottom and X = U, ...".

       Thus, all we need to do when checking that any type flows to a
       polymorphic type is to follow the same principles used when checking that
       a polymorphic definition has a polymorphic type. This has the pleasant
       side effect that the type we're checking does not itself need to be a
       polymorphic type at all! For example, we can let a non-generic method be
       overridden with a generic method, as long as the non-generic signature

           not included as part of the ensuing errors due to such unification.

           Instead, we fall back to using `any` as type arguments when they are
           missing. This conforms to the general intuition that all
           instantiations of a polymorphic type Foo are subtypes of Foo. When
           falling back to `any` is inadequate, we force the programmer to be
           explicit about what the type arguments of a polymorphic type are in
           an annotation. Overall, this scheme reduces false positives as well
           as improves blaming when errors do arise.

           It is always possible to recover implicit instantiation by explicitly
           using `*`. *)

    (** In traditional type systems, object types are not extensible.  E.g., an
        object {x: 0, y: ""} has type {x: number; y: string}. While it is
        possible to narrow the object's type to hide some of its properties (aka
        width subtyping), extending its type to model new properties is
        impossible. This is not without reason: all object types would then be
        equatable via subtyping, thereby making them unsound.

        In JavaScript, on the other hand, objects can grow dynamically, and
        doing so is a common idiom during initialization (i.e., before they
        become available for general use). Objects that typically grow
        dynamically include not only object literals, but also prototypes,
        export objects, and so on. Thus, it is important to model this idiom.

        To balance utility and soundness, Flow's object types are extensible by
        default, but become sealed as soon as they are subject to width
        subtyping. However, implementing this simple idea needs a lot of care.

        To ensure that aliases have the same underlying type, object types are
        represented indirectly as pointers to records (rather than directly as
        records). And to ensure that typing is independent of the order in which
        fragments of code are analyzed, new property types can be added on gets
        as well as sets (and due to indirection, the new property types become
        immediately available to aliases).

        Looking up properties of an object, e.g. for the purposes of copying,
        when it is not fully initialized is prone to races, and requires careful
        manual reasoning about escape to avoid surprising results.

        Prototypes cause further complications. In JavaScript, objects inherit
        properties of their prototypes, and may override those properties. (This
        is similar to subclasses inheriting and overriding methods of
        superclasses.) At the same time, prototypes are extensible just as much
        as the objects they derive are. In other words, we want to maintain the
        invariant that an object's type is a subtype of its prototype's type,
        while letting them be extensible by default. This invariant is achieved
        by constraints that unify a property's type if and when that property
        exists both on the object and its prototype.

        Here's some example code with type calculations in comments. (We use the
        symbol >=> to denote a flow between a pair of types. The direction of
        flow roughly matches the pattern 'rvalue' >=> 'lvalue'.)

        var o = {}; // o:T, T |-> {}
        o.x = 4; // T |-> {x:X}, number >=> X
        var s:string = o.x; // ERROR: number >=> string

        function F() { } // F.prototype:P, P |-> {}
        var f = new F(); // f:O, O |-> {}&P

        F.prototype.m = function() { this.y = 4; } // P |-> {m:M}, ... >=> M
        f.m(); // O |-> {y:Y}&P, number >=> Y

    (** When some object-like type O1 flows to ObjAssignT(_,O2,X,_,false), the
        properties of O1 are copied to O2, and O2 is linked to X to signal that
        the copying is done; the intention is that when those properties are
        read through X, they should be found (whereas this cannot be guaranteed
        when those properties are read through O2). However, there is an
        additional twist: this scheme may not work when O2 is unresolved. In
        particular, when O2 is unresolved, the constraints that copy the
        properties from O1 may race with reads of those properties through X as

   to be replaced by concrete types) so that speculation has a chance to fail
   early (and other branches are tried): otherwise, those failures may remain
   latent, and cause spurious errors to be reported. *)

(** TODO: Concretization is a general pattern that could be useful elsewhere as
    well. For example, we often have constraints that model "binary" operations,
    where both arguments need to be concretized for an operation to proceed
    (e.g., see rules involving AdderT, ComparatorT, ObjAssignT); in those cases,
    we effectively concretize the first argument, then the second argument by
    pushing the concretized first argument back into the constraint, and
    signaling that we are done afterwards. A general solution would have to do
    the following: specify parts of a constraint to be concretized, concretize
    those parts, replace the constraint with the concrete parts, and signal that
    we are done. The specification and replacement can be carried out generically
    using type substitution (see rules involving SpecializeT). The signaling
    could be done either by wrapping with ConcreteT, or by generically checking
    that the specified parts to be concretized have indeed been replaced with
    concrete parts. **)

      When satisfied, type obj flows to the recipient type result (in other

(* bounds manipulation *)
(***********************)

(** The following general considerations apply when manipulating bounds.

    1. All type variables start out as roots, but some of them eventually become
    goto nodes. As such, bounds of roots may contain goto nodes. However, we
    never perform operations directly on goto nodes; instead, we perform those
    operations on their roots. It is tempting to replace goto nodes proactively
    with their roots to avoid this issue, but doing so may be expensive, whereas
    the union-find data structure amortizes the cost of looking up roots.

    2. Another issue is that while the bounds of a type variable start out
    empty, and in particular do not contain the type variable itself, eventually
    other type variables in the bounds may be unified with the type variable. We
    do not remove these type variables proactively, but instead filter them out
    when considering the bounds. In the future we might consider amortizing the
    cost of this filtering.

    3. When roots are resolved, they act like the corresponding concrete
    types. We maintain the invariant that whenever lower bounds or upper bounds
    contain resolved roots, they also contain the corresponding concrete types.

    4. When roots are unresolved (they have lower bounds and upper bounds,
    possibly consisting of concrete types as well as type variables), we
    maintain the invarant that every lower bound has already been propagated to
    every upper bound. We also maintain the invariant that the bounds are
    transitively closed modulo equivalence: for every type variable in the
    bounds, all the bounds of its root are also included.

(********* Garbage collection *********)

(** Garbage collection (GC) for graphs refers to the act of "marking" reachable
    type variables from a given set of "roots," by following links between type
    variables and traversing their concrete bounds.

    We mark only those dependencies that may contribute to errors. In
    particular, only type variables that are indirectly reachable via concrete
    bounds are marked; directly reachable type variables via links are not
    marked, since Flow's algorithm ensures that their concrete bounds are
    already propagated.

    This is useful for pruning the graph, i.e., removing type variables in a
    graph that make no difference when the graph is merged with other graphs
    through its requires and exports. **)

(* State carried by GC, which includes most importantly a set of type variables
   marked as reachable. *)
class gc_state = object(this)
  val mutable _markedset = ISet.empty

  method markedset =
    _markedset

  method marked id =
    ISet.mem id _markedset

  method mark id =
    if this#marked id then false
    else (
      _markedset <- _markedset |> ISet.add id;
      true
    )
end

(* GC can be made more precise by respecting "polarity," which is just a fancy
   name that indicates the direction of walking: when a type variable is
   reached, we can walk only its lower bounds or its upper bounds based on the
   direction of the walk at that point.

   However, a directed walk requires determining the polarity of every part of
   every type. For some types, like those for functions, objects, arrays,
   etc. this is fairly standard. But for several other types, it is non-trivial
   to determine polarity: to do so, we need to carefully analyze how they appear
   in the flow rules, and whether their parts switch sides when those rules are
   simplified. Determining the wrong polarity in even one case can lead to
   hard-to-find bugs: at best, things crash because a type variable is reached
   that was marked unreachable, leading to a crash; at worst, a dependency is
   missed, leading to missed errors.

   Thus, do a conservative version of GC for now, that is undirected.

(****************** signature contexts *********************)

(* Once a context is merged with other contexts it depends on, it is ready to be
   optimized for use by contexts that in turn depend on it. The only interesting
   part of the context for such use is its exports. Thus, we call a context
   optimized for such use a "signature context."

   A signature context should contain only descriptions of its exports. Anything
   that does not contribute to those descriptions are redundant and should be
   discarded: otherwise, we would end up paying significant hidden costs, in
   terms of memory (storing in the heap) and time (serializing / deserializing
   from the heap, garbage collection pauses).

   As it turns out, it is not always possible or even desirable to describe the
   exports in "closed form" as types: instead, the descriptions take the form of
   a (mutually) recursive system of "equations" relating type variables to
   "solved" types, and the types themselves may contain these type variables
   inside. As indicated above, such descriptions are both necessary (due to
   recursive types) and desirable (due to sharing, and for cyclically depending
   contexts, due to the need to deal with the exports of all such contexts at
   once). This form is quite adequate for type checking (indeed, it can be
   thought of as merely a condensed form of usual contexts, which already
   exhibit this "interlinked" behavior).

   Unsurprisingly, since types also make references to some other maps in a
   context (property maps, envs), these references need to be carried around
   as well for the descriptions to be complete.

   We can collect compact and complete descriptions of exports by using a custom
   type visitor that marks relevant things that need to be carried over as it
   walks the context from its exports. Once the walk is done, we can replace the
   corresponding parts of the context (graph, property maps, envs) by their
   reduced forms.
