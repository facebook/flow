(* This module describes the subtyping algorithm that forms the core of
   typechecking. The algorithm (in its basic form) is described in Francois
   Pottier's thesis. The main data structures maintained by the algorithm are:
   (1) for every type variable, which type variables form its lower and upper
   bounds (i.e., flow in and out of the type variable); and (2) for every type
   variable, which concrete types form its lower and upper bounds. Every new
   subtyping constraint added to the system is deconstructed into its subparts,
   until basic flows between type variables and other type variables or concrete
   types remain; these flows are then viewed as links in a chain, bringing
   together further concrete types and type variables to participate in
   subtyping. This process continues till a fixpoint is reached---which itself
   is guaranteed to exist, and is usually reached in very few steps. *)

   logically implies "sealed" (and by contrapositive, "not sealed" implies
   "exact"; in other words, exact and sealed cannot both be false).

(* background:
   - each scope has an id. scope ids are unique, mod cloning
   for path-dependent analysis.
   - an environment is a scope list
   - each context holds a map of environment snapshots, keyed
   by their topmost scope ids
   - every function type contains a frame id, which maps to
   the environment in which it was defined; as well as a
   changeset containing its reads/writes/refinements on
   closed-over variables

   Given frame ids for calling function and called function and
   the changeset of the called function, here we retrieve the
   environment snapshots for the two functions, find the prefix
   of scopes they share, and havoc the variables in the called
   function's write set which live in those scopes.

    (* type applications *)
    (*********************)

    (* Sometimes a polymorphic class may have a polymorphic method whose return
       type is a type application on the same polymorphic class, possibly
       expanded. See Array#map or Array#concat, e.g. It is not unusual for
       programmers to reuse variables, assigning the result of a method call on
       a variable to itself, in which case we could get into cycles of unbounded
       instantiation. We use caching to cut these cycles. Caching relies on
       reasons (see module Cache.I). This is OK since intuitively, there should
       be a unique instantiation of a polymorphic definition for any given use
       of it in the source code.

       In principle we could use caching more liberally, but we don't because
       not all use types arise from source code, and because reasons are not
       perfect. Indeed, if we tried caching for all use types, we'd lose
       precision and report spurious errors.

       Also worth noting is that we can never safely cache def types. This is
       because substitution of type parameters in def types does not affect
       their reasons, so we'd trivially lose precision. *)

    (***********************)
    (* Singletons and keys *)
    (***********************)

    (** Finite keysets over arbitrary objects can be represented by KeysT. While
        it is possible to also represent singleton string types using KeysT (by
        taking the keyset of an object with a single property whose key is that
        string and whose value is ignored), we can model them more directly
        using SingletonStrT. Specifically, SingletonStrT models a type
        annotation that looks like a string literal, which describes a singleton
        set containing that string literal. Going further, other uses of KeysT
        where the underlying object is created solely for the purpose of
        describing a keyset can be modeled using unions of singleton strings.

        One may also legitimately wonder why SingletonStrT(_, key) cannot be
        always replaced by StrT(_, Some key). The reason is that types of the

    (* When do we consider a polymorphic type <X:U> UseT to be a subtype of another
       polymorphic type <X:U'> T'? This is the subject of a long line of
       research. A rule that works (Cardelli/Wegner) is: force U = U', and prove
       that UseT is a subtype of T' for any X:U'. A more general rule that proves
       that U' is a subtype of U instead of forcing U = U' is known to cause
       undecidable subtyping (Pierce): the counterexamples are fairly
       pathological, but can be reliably constructed by exploiting the "switch"
       of bounds from U' to U (and back, with sufficient trickery), in ways that
       are difficult to detect statically.

       However, these results are somewhat tricky to interpret in Flow, since we
       are not proving stuff inductively: instead we are co-inductively assuming
       what we want to prove, and checking consistency.

       Separately, none of these rules capture the logical interpretation of the
       original subtyping question (interpreting subtyping as implication, and
       polymorphism as universal quantification). What we really want to show is
       that, for all X:U', there is some X:U such that UseT is a subtype of T'. But
       we already deal with statements of this form when checking polymorphic
       definitions! In particular, statements such as "there is some X:U...")
       correspond to "create a type variable with that constraint and ...", and
       statements such as "show that for all X:U" correspond to "show that for
       both X = bottom and X = U, ...".

       Thus, all we need to do when checking that any type flows to a
       polymorphic type is to follow the same principles used when checking that

    (** In traditional type systems, object types are not extensible.  E.g., an
        object {x: 0, y: ""} has type {x: number; y: string}. While it is
        possible to narrow the object's type to hide some of its properties (aka
        width subtyping), extending its type to model new properties is
        impossible. This is not without reason: all object types would then be
        equatable via subtyping, thereby making them unsound.

        In JavaScript, on the other hand, objects can grow dynamically, and
        doing so is a common idiom during initialization (i.e., before they
        become available for general use). Objects that typically grow
        dynamically include not only object literals, but also prototypes,
        export objects, and so on. Thus, it is important to model this idiom.

        To balance utility and soundness, Flow's object types are extensible by
        default, but become sealed as soon as they are subject to width
        subtyping. However, implementing this simple idea needs a lot of care.

        To ensure that aliases have the same underlying type, object types are
        represented indirectly as pointers to records (rather than directly as
        records). And to ensure that typing is independent of the order in which
        fragments of code are analyzed, new property types can be added on gets
        as well as sets (and due to indirection, the new property types become
        immediately available to aliases).

        Looking up properties of an object, e.g. for the purposes of copying,
        when it is not fully initialized is prone to races, and requires careful
        manual reasoning about escape to avoid surprising results.

        Prototypes cause further complications. In JavaScript, objects inherit
        properties of their prototypes, and may override those properties. (This
        is similar to subclasses inheriting and overriding methods of
        superclasses.) At the same time, prototypes are extensible just as much
        as the objects they derive are. In other words, we want to maintain the
        invariant that an object's type is a subtype of its prototype's type,
        while letting them be extensible by default. This invariant is achieved
        by constraints that unify a property's type if and when that property
        exists both on the object and its prototype.

        Here's some example code with type calculations in comments. (We use the
        symbol >=> to denote a flow between a pair of types. The direction of
        flow roughly matches the pattern 'rvalue' >=> 'lvalue'.)

        var o = {}; // o:T, UseT |-> {}
        o.x = 4; // UseT |-> {x:X}, number >=> X
        var s:string = o.x; // ERROR: number >=> string

        function F() { } // F.prototype:P, P |-> {}
        var f = new F(); // f:O, O |-> {}&P

        F.prototype.m = function() { this.y = 4; } // P |-> {m:M}, ... >=> M
        f.m(); // O |-> {y:Y}&P, number >=> Y

    (** When some object-like type O1 flows to ObjAssignT(_,O2,X,_,false), the
        properties of O1 are copied to O2, and O2 is linked to X to signal that
        the copying is done; the intention is that when those properties are
        read through X, they should be found (whereas this cannot be guaranteed
        when those properties are read through O2). However, there is an
        additional twist: this scheme may not work when O2 is unresolved. In
        particular, when O2 is unresolved, the constraints that copy the
        properties from O1 may race with reads of those properties through X as
        soon as O2 is resolved. To avoid this race, we make O2 flow to
        ObjAssignT(_,O1,X,_,true); when O2 is resolved, we make the switch. **)

   properties is available even when the other objects supplying the properties
   are not yet available. In the `mergeProperties` model (spread_objects), a new
   object receives properties from other objects and is returned, but the new
   object is made available only when the properties have actually been
   received. Similarly, clone_object makes the receiving object available only

(* Some types need their parts to be concretized (i.e., type variables may need
   to be replaced by concrete types) so that speculation has a chance to fail
   early (and other branches are tried): otherwise, those failures may remain
   latent, and cause spurious errors to be reported. *)

(** TODO: switch to concretization for other types that need multiple parts
    to be concretized, e.g. AdderT, ComparatorT, ObjAssignT... *)

(** Upper and lower bounds have disjoint concretization processes, and we
    look for different types to concretize in each case. But the processes
    have the same general shape:

    1. A particular rule needs an UB (resp. LB) to be fully concrete to
    proceed, so it calls upper/lower_parts_to_concretize. If the type is fully
    concrete already, an empty list is returned, otherwise the list contains
    component types to be concretized. (The caller should treat this list as
    an opaque value, apart from testing its emptiness.)

    2. If the list from step 1 is non-empty, concretization is needed, and
    the rule calls concretize_upper/lower_parts, passing the the (LB, UB)
    pair along with the concretization list. This kicks off the concretization
    process, which uses ConcretizeLower/UpperT to work through the list of
    types without further intervention.

    (Note that concretization is not quite a simple recursive traversal of
    the concretization list: when a tvar is exposed for concretization, the
    edge from that tvar to the ConcretizeLower/UpperT holding the snapshot
    of the corresponding concretization state persists in the graph: many
    concrete LBs may flow through a tvar, and each induces a different
    overall concretization.)

    3. When the concretization process reaches the end of the todo list,
    replace_upper/lower_concrete_types will build a fresh type using the
    concretized parts, and feed the resulting LB/UB pair back into the flow
    function.

    There's no fundamental need for the finished type to be structurally
    similar to the original: in addition to concretizing, the final step
    can do arbitrary transforms.

    But note the importance of guaranteeing termination: for the typechecker
    not to loop[1], a type must eventually yield an empty concretization list
    if passed repeatedly through this process. Every use-case so far will in
    fact yield an empty list in one step, and there's no reason to think
    that multiple steps will ever be needed.

    But care should be taken to avoid simply returning an incoming type as a
    concretized result when there's nothing to do: instead these types should
    return an empty concretization list (concretization is partial, not
    idempotent).

    [1] The FlowConstraint cache will prevent the typechecker from actually
    looping, but the circuit breaker will also prevent further typechecking
    from taking place, making the error silent. To help trap this situation
    we emit an explicit internal error when this equality is detected.
  *)

(** Concretize an upper bound.

    Currently we only need to concretize FunT and CallT UBs, to support
    overloaded function selection. Here we'll request concretization
    for any such type with tvars in its param list.

(* bounds manipulation *)
(***********************)

(** The following general considerations apply when manipulating bounds.

    1. All type variables start out as roots, but some of them eventually become
    goto nodes. As such, bounds of roots may contain goto nodes. However, we
    never perform operations directly on goto nodes; instead, we perform those
    operations on their roots. It is tempting to replace goto nodes proactively
    with their roots to avoid this issue, but doing so may be expensive, whereas
    the union-find data structure amortizes the cost of looking up roots.

    2. Another issue is that while the bounds of a type variable start out
    empty, and in particular do not contain the type variable itself, eventually
    other type variables in the bounds may be unified with the type variable. We
    do not remove these type variables proactively, but instead filter them out
    when considering the bounds. In the future we might consider amortizing the
    cost of this filtering.

    3. When roots are resolved, they act like the corresponding concrete
    types. We maintain the invariant that whenever lower bounds or upper bounds
    contain resolved roots, they also contain the corresponding concrete types.

    4. When roots are unresolved (they have lower bounds and upper bounds,
    possibly consisting of concrete types as well as type variables), we
    maintain the invarant that every lower bound has already been propagated to
    every upper bound. We also maintain the invariant that the bounds are
    transitively closed modulo equivalence: for every type variable in the
    bounds, all the bounds of its root are also included.

   example of such a type is any. Overall, we want unification to be a sound
   "optimization," in the sense that replacing bidirectional flows with
   unification should not miss errors. But consider a scenario where we have a
   type variable with two incoming flows, string and any, and two outgoing
   flows, number and any. If we replace the flows from/to any with an
   unification with any, we will miss the string/number incompatibility error.

   However, unifying with any-like types is sometimes desirable /
   intentional. Thus, we limit the set of types on which unification is banned
   to just AnyWithUpperBoundT and AnyWithLowerBoundT, which are internal types.
