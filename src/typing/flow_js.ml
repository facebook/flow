(* This module describes the subtyping algorithm that forms the core of
   typechecking. The algorithm (in its basic form) is described in Francois
   Pottier's thesis. The main data structures maintained by the algorithm are:
   (1) for every type variable, which type variables form its lower and upper
   bounds (i.e., flow in and out of the type variable); and (2) for every type
   variable, which concrete types form its lower and upper bounds. Every new
   subtyping constraint added to the system is deconstructed into its subparts,
   until basic flows between type variables and other type variables or concrete
   types remain; these flows are then viewed as links in a chain, bringing
   together further concrete types and type variables to participate in
   subtyping. This process continues till a fixpoint is reached---which itself
   is guaranteed to exist, and is usually reached in very few steps. *)

(* The following functions are used as constructors for function types and

   meaningful in all contexts. This part of the design should be revisited:
   perhaps the data types can be refactored to make them more specialized. *)

(* Methods may use a dummy statics object type to carry properties. We do not
   want to encourage this pattern, but we also don't want to block uses of this
   pattern. Thus, we compromise by not tracking the property types. *)

(* A bound function type is a function type with `this` = `any`. Typically, such

   when calling that method through any object would be fine, since the object
   would be ignored. *)

(* A function type has `this` = `mixed`. Such a type can be given to functions
   that are meant to be called directly. On the other hand, it deliberately
   causes problems when they are given to methods in which `this` is used
   non-trivially: indeed, calling them directly would cause `this` to be bound
   to the global object, which is typically unintended. *)

(* An object type has two flags, sealed and exact. A sealed object type cannot
   be extended. An exact object type accurately describes objects without
   "forgeting" any properties: so to extend an object type with optional
   properties, the object type must be exact. Thus, as an invariant, "not exact"
   logically implies "sealed" (and by contrapositive, "not sealed" implies
   "exact"; in other words, exact and sealed cannot both be false).

   Types of object literals are exact, but can be sealed or unsealed. Object
   type annotations are sealed but not exact. *)

(* background:
   - each scope has an id. scope ids are unique, mod cloning
   for path-dependent analysis.
   - an environment is a scope list
   - each context holds a map of environment snapshots, keyed
   by their topmost scope ids
   - every function type contains a frame id, which maps to
   the environment in which it was defined; as well as a
   changeset containing its reads/writes/refinements on
   closed-over variables

   Given frame ids for calling function and called function and
   the changeset of the called function, here we retrieve the
   environment snapshots for the two functions, find the prefix
   of scopes they share, and havoc the variables in the called
   function's write set which live in those scopes.

(* Helper module for full type resolution as needed to check union and
   intersection types.

   Given a type, we walk it to collect the parts of it we wish to resolve. Once
   these parts are resolved, they must themselves be walked to collect further
   parts to resolve, and so on. In other words, type resolution jobs are created
   and processed in rounds, moving closer and closer to full resolution of the
   original type. Needless to say, these jobs can be recursive, and so must be
   managed carefully for termination and performance. The job management itself
   is done in Graph_explorer. (The jobs are naturally modeled as a graph with
   dynamically created nodes and edges.)

   Here, we define the function that creates a single round of such jobs.
*)

module ResolvableTypeJob = struct

  (* A datatype describing type resolution jobs.

     We unfold types as we go, looking for parts that cannot be unfolded
     immediately (thus needing resolution to proceed).

     The handling of these parts involve calls to `flow` and `unify`, and is
     thus decoupled from the walker itself for clarity. Here, we just create
     different jobs for different parts encountered. These jobs are further
     processed by bindings_of_jobs.

     Briefly, jobs are created for the following cases. (1) Annotation sources
     need to be resolved. (2) So do heads of type applications. (3) Resolved
     tvars are recursively unfolded, but we need to remember which resolved
     tvars have been unfolded to prevent infinite unfolding. (4) Unresolved
     tvars are handled differently based on context: when they are expected
     (e.g., when they are part of inferred types), they are logged; when they
     are unexpected (e.g., when they are part of annotations), they are
     converted to `any`. For more details see bindings_of_jobs.

    (* Full type resolution *)
    (************************)

    (* Full resolution of a type involves (1) walking the type to collect a
       bunch of unresolved tvars (2) emitting constraints that, once those tvars
       are resolved, recursively trigger the process for the resolved types (3)
       finishing when no unresolved tvars remain.

       (1) is covered in ResolvableTypeJob. Below, we cover (2) and (3).

       For (2), we emit a FullyResolveType constraint on any unresolved tvar
       found by (1). These unresolved tvars are chosen so that they have the
       following nice property, called '0->1': they remain unresolved until, at
       some point, they are unified with a concrete type. Moreover, the act of
       resolution coincides with the appearance of one (the first and the last)
       upper bound. (In general, unresolved tvars can accumulate an arbitrary
       number of lower and upper bounds over its lifetime.) More details can be
       found in bindings_of_jobs.

       For (3), we create a special "goal" tvar that acts like a promise for
       fully resolving the original type, and emit a Trigger constraint on the
       goal when no more work remains.

       The main client of full type resolution is checking union and
       intersection types. The check itself is modeled by a TryFlow constraint,
       which is guarded by a goal tvar that corresponds to some full type
       resolution requirement. Eventually, this goal is "triggered," which in
       turn triggers the check. (The name "TryFlow" refers to the technique used
       in the check, which literally tries each branch of the union or
       intersection in turn, maintaining some matching state as it goes: see
       speculative_matches for details). *)

    (* Intersection types need a preprocessing step before they can be checked;
       this step brings it closer to parity with the checking of union types,
       where the preprocessing effectively happens "automatically." This
       apparent asymmetry is explained in prep_try_intersection.

       Here, it suffices to note that the preprocessing step involves
       concretizing some types. Type concretization is distinct from full type
       resolution. Whereas full type resolution is a recursive process that
       needs careful orchestration, type concretization is a relatively simple
       one-step process: a tvar is concretized when any lower bound appears on
       it. Also, unlike full type resolution, the tvars that are concretized
       don't necessarily have the 0->1 property: they could be concretized at
       different types, as more and more lower bounds appear. *)

    (** TODO: This rule allows interpreting an object as a type!

        It is currently used to work with modules that export named types,
        e.g. 'react' or 'immutable'. For example, one can do

        `import type React from 'react'`

        followed by uses of `React` as a container of types in (say) type
        definitions like

        `type C = React.Component<any,any,any>`

        Fortunately, in that case `React` is stored as a type binding in the
        environment, so it cannot be used as a value.

        However, removing this special case causes no loss of expressibility
        (while making the model simpler). For example, in the above example we
        can write

        `import type { Component } from 'react'`

        followed by (say)

        `type C = Component<any,any,any>`

        Overall, we should be able to (at least conceptually) desugar `import
        type` to `import` followed by `type`.

       As a module to be exported, ModuleT denotes a "growing" module. In this
       form, its contents may change: e.g., its named exports may be
       extended. Conversely, the rules that drive this growing phase can expect
       to work only on ModuleT. In particular, modules that are not @flow never
       hit growing rules: they are modeled as `any`.

       On the other hand, as an imported module, ModuleT denotes a "fully
       formed" module. The rules hit by such a module don't grow it: they just
       take it apart and read it. The same rules could also be hit by modules
       that are not @flow, so the rules have to deal with `any`. *)

     * Handling for the idx() custom function.
     *
     * idx(a, a => a.b.c) is a 2-arg function with semantics meant to simlify
     * the process of extracting a property from a chain of maybe-typed property
     * accesses.
     *
     * As an example, if you consider an object type such as:
     *
     *   {
     *     me: ?{
     *       firstName: string,
     *       lastName: string,
     *       friends: ?Array<User>,
     *     }
     *   }
     *
     * The process of getting to the friends of my first friend (safely) looks
     * something like this:
     *
     *   let friendsOfFriend = obj.me && obj.me.friends && obj.me.friends[0]
     *                         && obj.me.friends[0].friends;
     *
     * This is verbose to say the least. To simplify, we can define a function
     * called idx() as:
     *
     *   function idx(obj, callback) {
     *     try { return callback(obj); } catch (e) {
     *       if (isNullPropertyAccessError(e)) {
     *         return null;
     *       } else {
     *         throw e;
     *       }
     *     }
     *   }
     *
     * This function can then be used to safely dive into the aforementioned
     * object tersely:
     *
     *  let friendsOfFriend = idx(obj, obj => obj.me.friends[0].friends);
     *
     * If we assume these semantics, then we can model the type of this function
     * by wrapping the `obj` parameter in a special signifying wrapper type that
     * is only valid against use types associated with property accesses. Any
     * time this specially wrapper type flows into a property access operation,
     * we:
     *
     * 1) Strip away any potential MaybeT from the contained type
     * 2) Forward the un-Maybe'd type on to the access operation
     * 3) Wrap the result back in the special wrapper
     *
     * We can then flow this wrapped `obj` to a call on the callback function,
     * remove the wrapper from the return type, and return that value wrapped in
     * a MaybeT.
     *
     * ...of course having a `?.` operator in the language would be a nice
     *    reason to throw all of this clownerous hackery away...

    (* type applications *)
    (*********************)

    (* Sometimes a polymorphic class may have a polymorphic method whose return
       type is a type application on the same polymorphic class, possibly
       expanded. See Array#map or Array#concat, e.g. It is not unusual for
       programmers to reuse variables, assigning the result of a method call on
       a variable to itself, in which case we could get into cycles of unbounded
       instantiation. We use caching to cut these cycles. Caching relies on
       reasons (see module Cache.I). This is OK since intuitively, there should
       be a unique instantiation of a polymorphic definition for any given use
       of it in the source code.

       In principle we could use caching more liberally, but we don't because
       not all use types arise from source code, and because reasons are not
       perfect. Indeed, if we tried caching for all use types, we'd lose
       precision and report spurious errors.

       Also worth noting is that we can never safely cache def types. This is
       because substitution of type parameters in def types does not affect
       their reasons, so we'd trivially lose precision. *)

    (* Predicate refinements on intersections of object types need careful

       be the intersection as a whole, not the particular object type that
       passes the predicate! (For example, we may check some condition on
       property x and property y of { x: ... } & { y: ... } in sequence, and not
       expect to get property-not-found errors in the process.)

       Although this seems like a special case, it's not. An intersection of

       object type with all the properties of those object types. The added

    (* Singletons and keys *)
    (***********************)

    (** Finite keysets over arbitrary objects can be represented by KeysT. While
        it is possible to also represent singleton string types using KeysT (by
        taking the keyset of an object with a single property whose key is that
        string and whose value is ignored), we can model them more directly
        using SingletonStrT. Specifically, SingletonStrT models a type
        annotation that looks like a string literal, which describes a singleton
        set containing that string literal. Going further, other uses of KeysT
        where the underlying object is created solely for the purpose of
        describing a keyset can be modeled using unions of singleton strings.

        One may also legitimately wonder why SingletonStrT(_, key) cannot be
        always replaced by StrT(_, Some key). The reason is that types of the
        latter form (string literal types) are inferred to be the type of string
        literals appearing as values, and we don't want to prematurely narrow
        down the type of the location where such values may appear, since that
        would preclude other strings to be stored in that location. Thus, by
        necessity we allow all string types to flow to StrT (whereas only
        exactly matching string literal types may flow to SingletonStrT).  **)

    (*******************************************)

    (** Call to predicated (latent) functions *)

    (* Calls to functions appearing in predicate refinement contexts dispatch
       to this case. Here, the return type of the function holds the predicate
       that will refine the incoming `unrefined_t` and flow a filtered
       (refined) version of this type into `fresh_t`.

       What is important to note here is that `return_t` has no access to the
       function's parameter names. It will simply be an `OpenPredT` containing
       mappings from symbols (Key.t) that are (hopefully) the function's
       parameters to predicates. In other words, it is an "open" predicate over
       (free) variables, which *should* be the function's parameters.

       The `CallLatentPredT` use contains the index of the argument under
       refinement. By combining this information with the names of the
       parameters in `params_names`, we can arrive to the actual name (Key.t)
       of the parameter that gets refined, which can be used as a key into the
       `OpenPredT` that is expected to eventually flow to `return_t`.
       Effectively, we are substituting the actual parameter to the refining
       call (here in the form of the index of the argument to the call) to the
       formal parameter of the function, and this information is stored in
       `CallOpenPredT` of the produced flow.

       Problematic cases (e.g. when the refining index is out of bounds w.r.t.
       `params_names`) raise errors, but also propagate the unrefined types
       (as if the refinement never took place).

    (* When do we consider a polymorphic type <X:U> T to be a subtype of another

       research. A rule that works (Cardelli/Wegner) is: force U = U', and prove
       that T is a subtype of T' for any X:U'. A more general rule that proves
       that U' is a subtype of U instead of forcing U = U' is known to cause
       undecidable subtyping (Pierce): the counterexamples are fairly
       pathological, but can be reliably constructed by exploiting the "switch"
       of bounds from U' to U (and back, with sufficient trickery), in ways that
       are difficult to detect statically.

       However, these results are somewhat tricky to interpret in Flow, since we
       are not proving stuff inductively: instead we are co-inductively assuming
       what we want to prove, and checking consistency.

       Separately, none of these rules capture the logical interpretation of the
       original subtyping question (interpreting subtyping as implication, and
       polymorphism as universal quantification). What we really want to show is
       that, for all X:U', there is some X:U such that T is a subtype of T'. But
       we already deal with statements of this form when checking polymorphic
       definitions! In particular, statements such as "there is some X:U...")
       correspond to "create a type variable with that constraint and ...", and
       statements such as "show that for all X:U" correspond to "show that for
       both X = bottom and X = U, ...".

       Thus, all we need to do when checking that any type flows to a
       polymorphic type is to follow the same principles used when checking that
       a polymorphic definition has a polymorphic type. This has the pleasant
       side effect that the type we're checking does not itself need to be a
       polymorphic type at all! For example, we can let a non-generic method be
       overridden with a generic method, as long as the non-generic signature
       can be derived as a specialization of the generic signature. *)

    (** In traditional type systems, object types are not extensible.  E.g., an
        object {x: 0, y: ""} has type {x: number; y: string}. While it is
        possible to narrow the object's type to hide some of its properties (aka
        width subtyping), extending its type to model new properties is
        impossible. This is not without reason: all object types would then be
        equatable via subtyping, thereby making them unsound.

        In JavaScript, on the other hand, objects can grow dynamically, and
        doing so is a common idiom during initialization (i.e., before they
        become available for general use). Objects that typically grow
        dynamically include not only object literals, but also prototypes,
        export objects, and so on. Thus, it is important to model this idiom.

        To balance utility and soundness, Flow's object types are extensible by
        default, but become sealed as soon as they are subject to width
        subtyping. However, implementing this simple idea needs a lot of care.

        To ensure that aliases have the same underlying type, object types are
        represented indirectly as pointers to records (rather than directly as
        records). And to ensure that typing is independent of the order in which
        fragments of code are analyzed, new property types can be added on gets
        as well as sets (and due to indirection, the new property types become
        immediately available to aliases).

        Looking up properties of an object, e.g. for the purposes of copying,
        when it is not fully initialized is prone to races, and requires careful
        manual reasoning about escape to avoid surprising results.

        Prototypes cause further complications. In JavaScript, objects inherit
        properties of their prototypes, and may override those properties. (This
        is similar to subclasses inheriting and overriding methods of
        superclasses.) At the same time, prototypes are extensible just as much
        as the objects they derive are. In other words, we want to maintain the
        invariant that an object's type is a subtype of its prototype's type,
        while letting them be extensible by default. This invariant is achieved
        by constraints that unify a property's type if and when that property
        exists both on the object and its prototype.

        Here's some example code with type calculations in comments. (We use the
        symbol >=> to denote a flow between a pair of types. The direction of
        flow roughly matches the pattern 'rvalue' >=> 'lvalue'.)

        var o = {}; // o:T, UseT |-> {}
        o.x = 4; // UseT |-> {x:X}, number >=> X
        var s:string = o.x; // ERROR: number >=> string

        function F() { } // F.prototype:P, P |-> {}
        var f = new F(); // f:O, O |-> {}&P

        F.prototype.m = function() { this.y = 4; } // P |-> {m:M}, ... >=> M
        f.m(); // O |-> {y:Y}&P, number >=> Y

    (** When some object-like type O1 flows to ObjAssignT(_,O2,X,_,false), the
        properties of O1 are copied to O2, and O2 is linked to X to signal that
        the copying is done; the intention is that when those properties are
        read through X, they should be found (whereas this cannot be guaranteed
        when those properties are read through O2). However, there is an
        additional twist: this scheme may not work when O2 is unresolved. In
        particular, when O2 is unresolved, the constraints that copy the
        properties from O1 may race with reads of those properties through X as
        soon as O2 is resolved. To avoid this race, we make O2 flow to
        ObjAssignT(_,O1,X,_,true); when O2 is resolved, we make the switch. **)

    (* TODO: This rule doesn't interact very well with union-type checking. It
       looks up Function.prototype, which currently doesn't appear structurally
       in the function type, and thus may not be fully resolved when the
       function type is checked with a union containing the object
       type. Ideally, we should either add Function.prototype to function types
       or fully resolve them when resolving function types, but either way we
       might bomb perf without additional work. Meanwhile, we need an immediate
       fix for the common case where this bug shows up. So leaving this comment
       here as a marker for future work, while going with a band-aid solution
       for now, as motivated below.

       Fortunately, it is quite hard for a function type to successfully
       check against an object type, and even more unlikely when the latter
       is part of a union: the object type must only contain
       Function.prototype methods or statics. Quickly confirming that the
       check would fail before looking up Function.prototype (while falling
       back to the general rule when we cannot guarantee failure) is a safe
       optimization in any case, and fixes the commonly observed case where
       the union type contains both a function type and a object type as
       members, clearly intending for function types to match the former
       instead of the latter. *)

(* generics *)

(** Harness for testing parameterized types. Given a test function and a list
    of type params, generate a bunch of argument maps and invoke the test
    function on each, using Reason.TestID to keep the reasons generated by
    each test disjoint from the others.

    In the general case we simply test every combination of p = bot, p = bound
    for each param p. For many parameter lists this will be more than strictly
    necessary, but determining the minimal set of tests for interrelated params
    is subtle. For now, our only refinement is to isolate all params with an
    upper bound of MixedT (making them trivially unrelated to each other) and
    generate a smaller set of argument maps for these which only cover a) bot,
    bound for each param, and b) every pairwise bot/bound combination. These
    maps are then used as seeds for powersets over the remaining params.

    NOTE: Since the same AST is traversed by each generated test, the order
    of generated tests is important for the proper functioning of hooks that
    record information on the side as ASTs are traversed. Adopting the
    convention that the last traversal "wins" (which would happen, e.g, when
    the recorded information at a location is replaced every time that
    location is encountered), we want the last generated test to always be
    the one where all type parameters are substituted by their bounds
    (instead of Bottom), so that the recorded information is the same as if
    all type parameters were indeed erased and replaced by their bounds.

(*******************************************************)
(* Entry points into the process of trying different   *)
(* branches of union and intersection types.           *)
(*******************************************************)

(* The problem we're trying to solve here is common to checking unions and
   intersections: how do we make a choice between alternatives, when (i) we have
   only partial information (i.e., while we're in the middle of type inference)
   and when (ii) we want to avoid regret (i.e., by not committing to an
   alternative that might not work out, when alternatives that were not
   considered could have worked out)?

   To appreciate the problem, consider what happens without choice. Partial
   information is not a problem: we emit constraints that must be satisfied for
   something to work, and either those constraints fail (indicating a problem)
   or they don't fail (indicating no problem). With choice and partial
   information, we cannot naively emit constraints as we try alternatives
   *without also having a mechanism to roll back those constraints*. This is
   because those constraints don't *have* to be satisfied; some other
   alternative may end up not needing those constraints to be satisfied for
   things to work out!

   It is not too hard to imagine scary scenarios we can get into without a
   roll-back mechanism. (These scenarios are not theoretical, by the way: with a
   previous implementation of union and intersection types that didn't
   anticipate these scenarios, they consistently caused a lot of problems in
   real-world use cases.)

   * One bad state we can get into is where, when trying an alternative, we emit
   constraints hoping they would be satisfied, and they appear to work. So we
   commit to that particular alternative. Then much later find out that those
   constraints are unsatified, at which point we have lost the ability to try
   other alternatives that could have worked. This leads to a class of bugs
   where a union or intersection type contains cases that should have worked,
   but they don't.

   * An even worse state we can get into is where we do discover that an
   alternative won't work out while we're still in a position of choosing
   another alternative, but in the process of making that discovery we emit
   constraints that linger on in a ghost-like state. Meanwhile, we pick another
   alternative, it works out, and we move on. Except that much later the ghost
   constraints become unsatisfied, leading to much confusion on the source of
   the resulting errors. This leads to a class of bugs where we get spurious
   errors even when a union or intersection type seems to have worked.

   So, we just implement roll-back, right? Basically...yes. But rolling back
   constraints is really hard in the current implementation. Instead, we try to
   avoid processing constraints that have side effects as much as possible while
   trying alternatives: by ensuring that (1) we don't (need to) emit too many
   constraints that have side effects (2) those that we do emit get deferred,
   instead of being processed immediately, until a choice can be made, thereby
   not participating in the choice-making process.

   (1) How do we ensure we don't emit too many constraints that have side
   effects? By fully resolving types before they participate in the
   choice-making process. Basically, we want to have as much information as we
   can before trying alternatives. It is a nice property of our implementation
   that once types are resolved, constraints emitted against them don't have
   (serious) side effects: they get simplified and simplified until we either
   hit success or failure. The details of this process is described in
   ResolvableTypeJob and in resolve_bindings.

   (2) But not all types can be fully resolved. In particular, while union and
   intersection types themselves can be fully resolved, the lower and upper
   bounds we check them against could have still-to-be-inferred types in
   them. How do we ensure that for the potentially side-effectful constraints we
   do emit on these types, we avoid undue side effects? By explicitly marking
   these types as unresolved, and deferring the execution of constraints that
   involved such marked types until a choice can be made. The details of this
   process is described in Speculation.

   There is a necessary trade-off in the approach. In particular, (2) means that
   sometimes choices cannot be made: it is ambiguous which constraints should be
   executed when trying different alternatives. We detect such ambiguities
   (conservatively, but only when a best-effort choice-making strategy doesn't
   work), and ask for additional annotations to disambiguate the relevant
   alternatives. A particularly nice property of this approach is that it is
   complete: with enough annotations it is always possible to make a
   choice. Another "meta-feature" of this approach is that it leaves room for
   incremental improvement: e.g., we would need fewer additional annotations as
   we improve our inference algorithm to detect cases where more unresolved
   tvars can be fully resolved ahead of time (in other words, detect when they
   have the "0->1" property, discussed elsewhere, roughly meaning they are
   determined by annotations).

(* Preprocessing for intersection types.

   Before feeding into the choice-making machinery described above, we
   preprocess upper bounds of intersection types. This preprocessing seems
   asymmetric, but paradoxically, it is not: the purpose of the preprocessing is
   to bring choice-making on intersections to parity with choice-making on
   unions.

   Consider what happens when a lower bound is checked against a union type. The
   lower bound is always concretized before a choice is made! In other words,
   even if we emit a flow from an unresolved tvar to a union type, the
   constraint fires only when the unresolved tvar has been concretized.

   Now, consider checking an intersection type with an upper bound. As an
   artifact of how tvars and concrete types are processed, the upper bound would
   appear to be concrete even though the actual parts of the upper bound that
   are involved in the choice-making may be unresolved! (These parts are the
   top-level input positions in the upper bound, which end up choosing between
   the top-level input positions in the members of the intersection type.) If we
   did not concretize the parts of the upper bound involved in choice-making, we
   would start the choice-making process at a disadvantage (compared to
   choice-making with a union type and an already concretized lower
   bound). Thus, we do an extra preprocessing step where we collect the parts of
   the upper bound to be concretized, and for each combination of concrete types
   for those parts, call the choice-making process.
*)

(** The following function concretizes each tvar in unresolved in turn,
    recording their corresponding concrete lower bounds in resolved as it
    goes. At each step, it emits a ConcretizeTypes constraint on an unresolved
    tvar, which in turn calls into this function when a concrete lower bound
    appears on that tvar. **)

(* Full type resolution *)
(************************)

(* Here we continue where we left off at ResolvableTypeJob. Once we have
   collected a set of type resolution jobs, we create so-called bindings from
   these jobs. A binding is a (id, tvar) pair, where tvar is what needs to be
   resolved, and id is an identifier that serves as an index for that job.

   We don't try to fully resolve unresolved tvars that are not annotation
   sources or heads of type applications, since in general they don't satify the
   0->1 property. Instead:

   (1) When we're expecting them, e.g., when we're looking at inferred types, we
   mark them so that we can recognize them later, during speculative matching.

   (2) When we're not expecting them, e.g., when we're fully resolving union /
   intersection type annotations, we unify them as `any`. Ideally we wouldn't be
   worrying about this case, but who knows what cruft we might have accumulated
   on annotation types, so just getting that cruft out of the way.

   These decisions were made in ResolvableTypeJob.collect_of_types and are
   reflected in the use (or not) of OpenUnresolved (see below).
*)

(* Let id be the identifier associated with a tvar that is not yet
   resolved. (Here, resolved/unresolved refer to the state of the tvar in the
   context graph: does it point to Resolved _ or Unresolved _?) As soon as the
   tvar is resolved to some type, we generate some bindings by walking that
   type. Full type resolution at id now depends on full resolution of the
   ids/tvars in those bindings. The following function ensures that those
   dependencies are recorded and processed.

   Dependency management happens in Graph_explorer, using efficient data
   structures discussed therein. All we need to do here is to connect id to
   bindings in that graph, while taking care that (1) the conditions of adding
   edges to the graph are satisfied, and (2) cleaning up the effects of adding
   those edges to the graph. Finally (3) we request full type resolution of the
   bindings themselves.

   For (1), note that the graph only retains transitively closed dependencies
   from one kind of tvars to another kind of tvars. The former kind includes
   tvars that are resolved but not yet fully resolved. The latter kind includes
   tvars that are not yet resolved. Thus, in particular we must filter out
   bindings that correspond to fully resolved tvars (see
   is_unfinished_target). On the other hand, the fully_resolve_type function
   below already ensures that id is not yet fully resolved (via
   is_unexplored_source).

   For (2), after adding edges we might discover that some tvars are now fully
   resolved: this happens when, e.g., no new transitively closed dependencies
   get added on id, and full type resolution of some tvars depended only on id.
   If any of these fully resolved tvars were goal tvars, we trigger them.

   For (3) we emit a ResolveType constraint for each binding; when the
   corresponding tvar is resolved, the function fully_resolve_type below is
   called, which in turn calls back into this function (thus closing the
   recursive loop).

(* Speculatively match several alternatives in turn, as presented when checking
   a union or intersection type. This process maintains a so-called "match
   state" that describes the best possible choice found so far, and can
   terminate in various ways:

   (1) One of the alternatives definitely succeeds. This is straightforward: we
   can safely discard any later alternatives.

   (2) All alternatives fail. This is also straightforward: we emit an
   appropriate error message.

   (3) One of the alternatives looks promising (i.e., it doesn't immediately
   fail, but it doesn't immediately succeed either: some potentially
   side-effectful constraints, called actions, were emitted while trying the
   alternative, whose execution has been deferred), and all the later
   alternatives fail. In this scenario, we pick the promising alternative, and
   then fire the deferred actions. This is fine, because the choice cannot cause
   regret: the chosen alternative was the only one that had any chance of
   succeeding.

   (4) Multiple alternatives look promising, but the set of deferred actions
   emitted while trying the first of those alternatives form a subset of those
   emitted by later trials. Here we pick the first promising alternative (and
   fire the deferred actions). The reason this is fine is similar to (3): once
   again, the choice cannot cause any regret, because if it failed, then the
   later alternatives would have failed too. So the chosen alternative had the
   best chance of succeeding.

   (5) But sometimes, multiple alternatives look promising and we really can't
   decide which is best. This happens when the set of deferred actions emitted
   by them are incomparable, or later trials have more chances of succeeding
   than previous trials. Such scenarios typically point to real ambiguities, and
   so we ask for additional annotations on unresolved tvars to disambiguate.

   See Speculation for more details on terminology and low-level mechanisms used
   here, including what bits of information are carried by match_state and case,
   how actions are deferred and diff'd, etc.

   Because this process is common to checking union and intersection types, we
   abstract the latter into a so-called "spec." The spec is used to customize
   error messages and to ignore unresolved tvars that are deemed irrelevant to
   choice-making.

(* bounds manipulation *)
(***********************)

(** The following general considerations apply when manipulating bounds.

    1. All type variables start out as roots, but some of them eventually become
    goto nodes. As such, bounds of roots may contain goto nodes. However, we
    never perform operations directly on goto nodes; instead, we perform those
    operations on their roots. It is tempting to replace goto nodes proactively
    with their roots to avoid this issue, but doing so may be expensive, whereas
    the union-find data structure amortizes the cost of looking up roots.

    2. Another issue is that while the bounds of a type variable start out
    empty, and in particular do not contain the type variable itself, eventually
    other type variables in the bounds may be unified with the type variable. We
    do not remove these type variables proactively, but instead filter them out
    when considering the bounds. In the future we might consider amortizing the
    cost of this filtering.

    3. When roots are resolved, they act like the corresponding concrete
    types. We maintain the invariant that whenever lower bounds or upper bounds
    contain resolved roots, they also contain the corresponding concrete types.

    4. When roots are unresolved (they have lower bounds and upper bounds,
    possibly consisting of concrete types as well as type variables), we
    maintain the invarant that every lower bound has already been propagated to
    every upper bound. We also maintain the invariant that the bounds are
    transitively closed modulo equivalence: for every type variable in the
    bounds, all the bounds of its root are also included.

(* Subtyping of arrays is complicated by tuples. Currently, there are three

   2. [T1, T2] (tuple type)
   3. "internal" Array<X>[T1, T2] where T1 | T2 ~> X (array literal type)

   We have the following rules:

   (1) When checking types against Array<U>, the rules are not surprising. Array
   literal types behave like array types in these checks.

   * Array<T> ~> Array<U> checks T <~> U
   * [T1, T2] ~> Array<U> checks T1 | T2 ~> U
   * Array<X>[T1, T2] ~> Array<U> checks Array<X> ~> Array<U>

   (2) When checking types against [T1, T2], the rules are again not
   surprising. Array literal types behave like tuple types in these checks. We
   consider missing tuple elements to be undefined, following common usage (and
   consistency with missing call arguments).

   * Array<T> ~> [U1, U2] checks T ~> U1, T ~> U2
   * [T1, T2] ~> [U1, U2] checks T1 ~> U1 and T2 ~> U2
   * [T1, T2] ~> [U1] checks T1 ~> U1
   * [T1] ~> [U1, U2] checks T1 ~> U1 and void ~> U2
   * Array<X>[T1, T2] ~> [U1, U2] checks [T1, T2] ~> [U1, U2]

   (3) When checking types against Array<Y>[U1, U2], the rules are a bit
   unsound. Array literal types were not designed to appear as upper bounds. In
   particular, their summary element types are often overly precise. Checking
   individual element types of one array literal type against the summary
   element type of another array literal type can lead to crazy errors, so we
   currently drop such checks.

   TODO: Make these rules great again by computing more reasonable summary
   element types for array literal types.

   * Array<T> ~> Array<Y>[U1, U2] checks Array<T> ~> Array<Y>
   * [T1, T2] ~> Array<Y>[U1, U2] checks T1 ~> U1, T2 ~> U2
   * [T1, T2] ~> Array<Y>[U1] checks T1 ~> U1
   * [T1] ~> Array<Y>[U1, U2] checks T1 ~> U1
   * Array<X>[T1, T2] ~> Array<Y>[U1, U2] checks [T1, T2] ~> Array<Y>[U1, U2]
