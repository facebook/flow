(** There are a bunch of functions that you expect to return a pid,

  process handle.

  Process handles act like pointers to a process. You can have
  more than one handle that points to a single process (unlike
  pids, where there is a single pid for a process).

  This isn't a problem normally, since functions like Unix.waitpid()
  will take the process handle on Windows. But if you want to print
  or log the pid, then you need to dereference the handle and get
  the pid. And that's what this function does. *)

  Use [get_pretty_pid] when showing the PID to the user, logging, etc. *)
