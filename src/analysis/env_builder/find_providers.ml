        this is the `state` type defined above, including information about the shallowest depth at which
        the variable's providers have been discovered. Later on in provider_api, this is replaced
        with a final state that excludes the depth information.
      * declare_locs are locations where a variable is declared with `let`, `var`, `const`, etc.
        In the vast majority of cases only one location will exist, but there can be multiple in
        the case of `vars` with branching control flow (e.g. `if (c) { var x = 10 } else { var x = 20 }`
        and overridden functions.
      * def_locs are locations where a variable is written to, typically assignments and updates. In this
        case, we exclude declarations--declare_locs and def_locs should be disjoint.
      * provider_locs are the candidate providers we're calculating in this module, and can be either declares or defs.
        Initially, in this module, 'locs will be instantiated as `write_state L.LMap.t`, recording what kind
        of write an indvidual candidate provider is. Later on, in provider_api, this will be simplified and filtered
        into a single `L.LSet.t` of providers

        We expect that the keys/elements of provider_locs are a subset of the union of def_locs and declare_locs.
