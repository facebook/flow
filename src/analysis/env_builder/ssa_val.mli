(* For every read of a variable x, we are interested in tracking writes to x
   that can reach that read. Ultimately the writes are going to be represented
   as a list of locations, where each location corresponds to a "single static
   assignment" of the variable in the code. But for the purposes of analysis, it
   is useful to represent these writes with a data type that contains either a
   single write, or a "join" of writes (in compiler terminology, a PHI node), or
   a reference to something that is unknown at a particular point in the AST
   during traversal, but will be known by the time traversal is complete. *)

   is not attached due to syntactic difference.
   e.g. refinements on obj.x should be attached to x in const {x} = obj *)
