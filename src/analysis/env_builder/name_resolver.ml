  (* For every read of a variable x, we are interested in tracking writes to x
     that can reach that read. Ultimately the writes are going to be represented
     as a list of locations, where each location corresponds to a "single static
     assignment" of the variable in the code. But for the purposes of analysis, it
     is useful to represent these writes with a data type that contains either a
     single write, or a "join" of writes (in compiler terminology, a PHI node), or
     a reference to something that is unknown at a particular point in the AST
     during traversal, but will be known by the time traversal is complete. *)

       * values in a loop before reading on.
       *
       * If we refine over a heap value x.foo in the loop guard then we have 2
       * possible scenarios that affect the post-loop refinement:
       * 1. x.foo changes in the loop
       * 2. x.foo does not change in the loop
       *
       * If x.foo does not change in the loop then there will be an
       * entry for x.foo in both the end-of-loop environment and the never-entered-loop
       * environment. We merge those two states and then apply the negated loop guard
       * in this case.
       *
       * while (x.foo === 3) {
       * }
       * x.foo; // x.foo did not change throughout the lifetime of the loop,
       *        // so we can safely merge the pre-state and post-state and add the negated
       *        // refinement. Both the pre- and post-states will have an entry for
       *        // x.foo because both traverse the refinement
       *
       * If x.foo _does_ change then we're in a more interesting situation. In this
       * case, it is possible for the end-of-loop environment to not contain a heap
       * entry for x.foo, so merging it with the never-entered-loop environment would
       * not add an entry for the heap refinement, and applying the negated refinement
       * would have no effect. To fix this, we take advantage of the fact that if
       * x.foo is changed then we havoc before analyzing the loop guard. That means
       * that the access in the loop guard is a fine location to use for the projection
       * at the base of the refinement. If we did not havoc, then we could end
       * up in a situation where x.foo was already refined at the loop guard and we
       * unsoundly carry that refinement into the post-loop state even though that refinement
       * was invalidated by the loop body.
       *
       * while (x.foo === 3) {
       *  f();
       * } // The post state of the loop has no entry for x.foo because

       * we'd need to ask for a lot of annotations. Moreover, it's not clear where
       * those annotations should go.
       *
       * Instead, we scout the body of the loop to find which variables are
       * written to. If a variable is written, then we havoc that variable
       * before entering the loop. This does not apply to variables that are
       * only refined.
       *
       * After visiting the body, we reset the state in the ssa environment,
       * havoc any vars that need to be havoced, and then visit the body again.
       * After that we negate the refinements on the loop guard.
       *
       * Here's how each param should be used:
       * scout: Visit the guard and any updaters if applicable, then visit the body
       * visit_guard_and_body: Visit the guard with a refinement scope, any updaters
       *   if applicable, and then visit the body. Return a tuple of the guard
       *   refinement scope, the env after the guard with no refinements, and the loop
       *   completion state.
       * make_completion_states: given the loop completion state, give the list of
       *   possible completion states for the loop. For do while loops this is different
       *   than regular while loops, so those two implementations may be instructive.
       * auto_handle_continues: Every loop needs to filter out continue completion states.
       *   The default behavior is to do that filtering at the end of the body.
       *   If you need to handle continues before that, like in a do/while loop, then
       *   set this to false. Ensure that you handle continues in both the scouting and
       *   main passes.

      (* Commit a set of refinements, all of which are linked biconditionally. If these refinements are negated,
         then the negation of each refinement should hold; separate calls to this function in the same
         refinement scope produce separate maps that are connected with an AND--and if they are negated, will produce
         an OR of negations of the maps.

         To see how this works, consider two cases:

          First,
            if (x && y) { } else { }
          In this case, we will call commit_refinement twice, each time with a Truthy refinement on either x or y.
          Inside the then case, x and y are both Truthy, but within the else case, we'll end up with a proposition
          like Or (x Falsey, y Falsey). This means that within the else case we don't actually know anything concrete
          about x or y.

          Compare that to
            if {x.y} { } else { }
          For this case, we will call commit_refinement only once, with a map that contains both the refinement x HasProp(y) and
          x.y Truthy. When we negate this, because we only called commit_refinement once and therefore our refinement propositon
          contains just a single set of refinements (not multiple ones conjuncted together), we'll end up with
          x NotHasProp(y) and x.y Falsey--which is what we want.
