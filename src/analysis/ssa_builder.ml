(* This module is responsible for building a mapping from variable reads to the
 * writes those reads. This is used in type checking to determine if a variable is
 * const-like, but the name_resolver is used to build the type checking envrionment.
 * The name_resolver copied much of the implementation here, but with sufficient divergence
 * to warrant forking the implementation.
 * If you're here to add support for a new syntax feature, you'll likely
 * need to modify the name_resolver as well, but not necessarily with identical changes.*)

  (* For every read of a variable x, we are interested in tracking writes to x
     that can reach that read. Ultimately the writes are going to be represented
     as a list of locations, where each location corresponds to a "single static
     assignment" of the variable in the code. But for the purposes of analysis, it
     is useful to represent these writes with a data type that contains either a
     single write, or a "join" of writes (in compiler terminology, a PHI node), or
     a reference to something that is unknown at a particular point in the AST
     during traversal, but will be known by the time traversal is complete. *)
