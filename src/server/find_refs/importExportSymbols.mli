(* Given a list of locations in this file, return the list of symbols which are related due to
 * imports or exports. This is used to determine the local bindings for exported/imported values and
 * vice-versa. In some cases, a returned location may be identical to a given location.
 * Some examples:
 *
 * Given the code: `export default function foo() {}`
 * - If given the location for `default`, will return the location for `foo`.
 * - If given the location for `foo`, will return the location for `default`.
 *
 * Given the code: `import {foo} from 'bar'`
 * - If given the location for `foo`, will return that same location.
