     need to be reparsed. they could be discovered by either a normal recheck or a prioritized
     recheck, and so need to be included in whichever kind happens next.

     for example, imagine we're doing a priority recheck and discover that [foo.js] needs to
     be rechecked, so we push it onto the workload stream and cancel the priority recheck. if
     [foo.js] was not included in the next priority workload, then it would fail and be retried

       include everything, we end up discovering a subset of the changes bit by bit as "unexpected
       changes" via [ensure_parsed], which is much slower. Also, we'll never find out about added
       files that way, so the results can end up being inaccurate -- until the file watcher catches
       up.

       so why do we track files_to_prioritize and files_to_recheck separately? files_to_prioritize
       become "dependency" updates. so here, priority_workload treats everything as a
       dependency -- updating the dependency graph and merging, but not checking -- but the
