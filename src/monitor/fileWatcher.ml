    (** When watchman restarts, we miss any filesystem changes that might happen while it's
        down. To re-synchronize, we need to recheck all of the files that could have changed
        while it wasn't watching:

        1) a file that was previously unchanged is now changed
        2) a changed file changed again
        3) a previously changed file was reverted
        4) the mergebase changed, changing some committed files

        Since we can ask watchman for the changes since mergebase, it can tell us about
        (1) and (2). We handle (3) separately, by setting [missed_changes = true] which
        triggers a recheck of all focused (i.e. previously changed) files. But we can't
        handle (4): watchman can't tell us all the files that changed between the two
        mergebase commits (`hg` can, but it's not worth implementing this). so if the
        mergebase changes, we restart. *)

           ******* GOAL *******
           *
           * We want to know when an N-files-changed notification is due to the user changing
           * their mergebase with master. This could be due to pulling master & rebasing their
           * work onto the new master, or just moving from one commit to another.
           *
           ******* PREVIOUS SOLUTION *******
           *
           * Unfortunately, Watchman's mercurial integration is racy and not to be trusted.
           * Previously we tried this:
           *
           * 1. Keep a count of how many transactions are currently in progress
           * 2. When hg.update ends, wait for the transaction count to drop to 0
           * 3. When there are 0 in-progress transactions, then query for the mergebase
           *
           * This worked pretty well, but looking at some logs I would see step 3 would not
           * always fire. Maybe we were missing some state_leave notifications. Also, the
           * source control people aren't confident that waiting for the transactions to
           * is a strong guarantee.
           *
           ******* CURRENT SOLUTION *******
           *
           * So this is a more simple solution. It's based around the assumption that once
           * Watchman tells us that N files have changed, things have settled down enough
           * that it's safe to query for the mergebase. And since querying for the mergebase
           * is expensive, we only do so when we see an hg.update. After an hg.update it's
           * more acceptable to delay a file-changed notification than after a user saves a
           * file in the IDE
           *)
