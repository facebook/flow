               ******* GOAL *******
               *
               * We want to know when an N-files-changed notification is due to the user changing
               * their mergebase with master. This could be due to pulling master & rebasing their
               * work onto the new master, or just moving from one commit to another.
               *
               ******* PREVIOUS SOLUTION *******
               *
               * Unfortunately, Watchman's mercurial integration is racy and not to be trusted.
               * Previously we tried this:
               *
               * 1. Keep a count of how many transactions are currently in progress
               * 2. When hg.update ends, wait for the transaction count to drop to 0
               * 3. When there are 0 in-progress transactions, then query for the mergebase
               *
               * This worked pretty well, but looking at some logs I would see step 3 would not
               * always fire. Maybe we were missing some state_leave notifications. Also, the
               * source control people aren't confident that waiting for the transactions to
               * is a strong guarantee.
               *
               ******* CURRENT SOLUTION *******
               *
               * So this is a more simple solution. It's based around the assumption that once
               * Watchman tells us that N files have changed, things have settled down enough
               * that it's safe to query for the mergebase. And since querying for the mergebase
               * is expensive, we only do so when we see an hg.update. After an hg.update it's
               * more acceptable to delay a file-changed notification than after a user saves a
               * file in the IDE
