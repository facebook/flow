(* So there's a bug in Unix.select on Windows. Basically, select is supposed to be
 * "level triggered". That is, as long as you select a ready fd, select should always return it.
 * This is opposed to an "edge triggered" API  which would only return the fd when it becomes
 * available.
 *
 * However, Unix.select doesn't seem to behave this way on Windows. If you call Unix.select with
 * only sockets, then it uses the select system call  and everything is fine. But if you call
 * Unix.select with a mix of fd types (like stdin and a socket, or a pipe and a socket), it
 * falls back to some other code.
 *
 * The long and the short of it is that sometimes a ready fd isn't returned by Unix.select on
 * Windows when you pass in a mix of sockets and non-sockets. The work around is to split the
 * single Unix.select call into multiple Unix.select calls.
