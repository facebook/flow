(* The Flow server monitor will start one or more Flow servers over its lifetime. This module is how
 * the monitor interacts with the server. The basic idea is that there is a long-lived stream of
 * requests, which outlives servers, and a ServerInstance.t that wraps a connection to the server.
 *
 * When a server is alive, the long lived stream of requests gets written to the server and stored
 * in a RequestMap. When a response is received, we look up the client in the RequestMap and forward
 * the response.
 *
 * When a server dies, the monitor decides whether or not to die with the server. If it doesn't die,
 * it creates a new server. Any request that was written to the old server but never received a
 * response will be written again to the new server
 *)
