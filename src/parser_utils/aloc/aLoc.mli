(* Creates an ALoc.t with a concrete underlying representation *)
val of_loc : Loc.t -> t

(* Takes an ALoc.t with a concrete underlying representation and makes it abstract.
 *
 * Preconditions:
 * - The given location cannot have already been abstractified.
 * - The file key with which the table was created must match the `source` of the given location.
 *   - This also implies that locations with `None` as the source cannot be abstractified. This
 *     could be relaxed in the future if necessary.
 * *)
val abstractify : table -> reverse_table -> t -> t

(* Takes an ALoc.t with a concrete underlying representation and finds
 * the existing abstract representation for it from a reverse table
 *
 * Preconditions:
 * - The file key with which the table was created must match the `source` of the given location.
