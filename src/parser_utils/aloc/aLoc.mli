(* Takes an ALoc.t with a concrete underlying representation and makes it abstract.
 *
 * Preconditions:
 * - The given location cannot have already been abstractified.
 * - The file key with which the table was created must match the `source` of the given location.
 *   - This also implies that locations with `None` as the source cannot be abstractified. This
 *     could be relaxed in the future if necessary.
 * *)
val abstractify: table -> t -> t

(* Converts an ALoc.t back to a Loc.t, looking up the underlying location in the given table if
 * necessary. We will have to look up tables in the shared heap at some point, so making it lazy
 * allows us to avoid fetching the table if the underlying location is actually concrete. *)
