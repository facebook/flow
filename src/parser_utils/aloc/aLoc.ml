   * which has a concrete underlying representation. Don't modify this unless you understand how
   * OCaml lays out values in memory.
   *
   * In order to achieve the zero-cost conversion, we have to use the same representation as `Loc.t`
   * for each `ALoc.t` that has a concrete underlying representation. By doing so, we can avoid any
   * new allocations, and simply use `Obj.magic` to return a pointer to the same heap-allocated
   * object with a different type.
   *
   * This also means that we must have a representation for actually-abstract `ALoc.t`s which is
   * distinct from every possible value of `Loc.t`. Fortunately, the start and end fields are both
   * pointers, and therefore cannot share a representation with any integer. We can take advantage
   * of this in order to differentiate between the kinds of `ALoc.t`s.
