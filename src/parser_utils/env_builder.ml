 * need to modify the ssa_builder as well, but not necessarily with identical changes.*)

       * would cause a lot of cycles in the ordering algorithm, which means
       * we'd need to ask for a lot of annotations. Moreover, it's not clear where
       * those annotations should go.
       *
       * Instead, we scout the body of the loop to find which variables are
       * written to. If a variable is written, then we havoc that variable
       * before entering the loop. This does not apply to variables that are
       * only refined.
       *
       * After visiting the body, we reset the state in the ssa environment,
       * havoc any vars that need to be havoced, and then visit the body again.
       * After that we negate the refinements on the loop guard.
       *
       * Here's how each param should be used:
       * scout: Visit the guard and any updaters if applicable, then visit the body
       * visit_guard_and_body: Visit the guard with a refinement scope, any updaters
       *   if applicable, and then visit the body. Return a tuple of the guard
       *   refinement scope, the env after the guard with no refinements, and the loop
       *   completion state.
       * make_completion_states: given the loop completion state, give the list of
       *   possible completion states for the loop. For do while loops this is different
       *   than regular while loops, so those two implementations may be instructive.
       * auto_handle_continues: Every loop needs to filter out continue completion states.
       *   The default behavior is to do that filtering at the end of the body.
       *   If you need to handle continues before that, like in a do/while loop, then
       *   set this to false. Ensure that you handle continues in both the scouting and
       *   main passes.
