Gatsby
Gatsby is the best way to create static websites with React. It lets you use React components, but outputs pre-rendered HTML and CSS to guarantee the fastest load time.

Learn Gatsby from its official guide and a gallery of starter kits.

More Flexible Toolchains
The following toolchains offer more flexibility and choice. We recommend them to more experienced users:

Neutrino combines the power of webpack with the simplicity of presets, and includes a preset for React apps and React components.
Nx is a toolkit for full-stack monorepo development, with built-in support for React, Next.js, Express, and more.
Parcel is a fast, zero configuration web application bundler that works with React.
Razzle is a server-rendering framework that doesnâ€™t require any configuration, but offers more flexibility than Next.js.
