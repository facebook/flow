// @flow

// Synthesizing an element of a polymorphic component synthesizes its children
// too, so a child element's name is read while the enclosing element's hint is
// evaluated. That name is a `jsx::Identifier`, not an expression, so the walk
// over the hint's synthesizable expressions used to miss it: `Line`'s entry was
// read before its def ran, resolving to a placeholder `any` that is cached and
// then reused by every later read -- silently dropping the error below.
