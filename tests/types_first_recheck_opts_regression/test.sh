# At the time this test was written, some strange logic for determining what to merge leads to a
# situation where we consider for merge all three files whenever `a.js` changes, but by *adding* a
# sig dependency edge, we are actually able to apply recheck opts. In the first recheck, we skip 1
# file in merge, but in the last one we skip 2 files.
