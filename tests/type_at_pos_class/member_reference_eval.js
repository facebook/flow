// @flow

// The receiver of a member access can be a type destructor rather than a plain
// object or instance. Expanding its members forces the destructor regardless of
// the normalizer's `evaluate_type_destructors` setting, so the property's kind
// still comes out. The qualifier, on the other hand, is read off the receiver
// left *unevaluated*, so it is there only when that form is still named: an
// alias over the destructor, or the operand the destructor normalizes back to.
