# dependency.js____/
#                  \____unrelated.js
#
# There is an unused suppression comment in focused.js. There is an unused
# suppression comment in dependency.js. There is a **used**
# suppression comment in dependency.js that suppresses an error in unrelated.js
#
# When we focus-check focused.js or dependency.js, the unused comment in
# focused.js should emit a warning.
#
# When we focus-check dependency.js, the unused comment in dependency.js emits
# a warning and the unused comment in focused.js emits a warning.
#
# Under no circumstance does the **used** suppression comment in dependency.js
# emit warning, even though it looks unused when we focus-check focused.js
