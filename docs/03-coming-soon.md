Flow is still in early stages, and we're iterating fast. Here's a (partial) list of features we're planning to add soon. As always, if you run into any bugs or have any feature requests, just let us know by filing issues on GitHub! 

* Support for converting existing TypeScript declaration files (.d.ts) for common libraries on DefinitelyTyped.org to Flow declarations.

* ES6 module support

* Compiling the Flow checker to JavaScript using js\_of\_ocaml

* Powerful types to precisely express framework APIs that make heavy internal use of common reflection patterns

* Editor integration for Flow type errors

* Flow commands to support IDEs, such as autocomplete

* Error message categorization and filtering by file

* Improved errors: better blame attribution and error traces

* A bunch of type system features like bounded polymorphism, enums, function purity analysis and lots more
