Since types are not part of the JavaScript specification, we need to strip them out before sending the file to the user. There are two ways to do so:

* You can use the JSX transform tool (part of the React tools), or a  [third party transform tool](https://github.com/facebook/flow/wiki/3rd-party-tools#transformers), to translate your files to plain JavaScript.
* For quick prototyping, you can run the transforms directly in the browser

## Using the offline transform tool

This is the recommended workflow for production. First, you need to install the React tools:

```bash
$> npm install -g react-tools
```

You can then simply run the transpiler in the background using the `jsx` command:

```bash
$> jsx --strip-types --harmony --watch src/ build/
```

This will run in the background, pick up any changes to files in `src/`, and create their pure JavaScript version in `build/`.

## Using the in-browser transform

This is **not** recommended for production, because it is not as performant as the offline transform tool. However it is a good way to get started with quick prototyping.

All you have to do is include the JSX transformer in your document (version 0.12.2 or later), and use a special MIME type for your Flow scripts:

```html
<head>
  <script src="build/JSXTransformer.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <script type="text/jsx;stripTypes=true;harmony=true">
  /* @flow */
  // ...
  </script>
</body>
```

Your script will then be transformed to plain JavaScript when it is loaded by the browser.

## Transpiler in action

You can try out the live Flow transpiler below: just edit the Flow script in the top window, and the transformed JavaScript will update in the second window.

<script>var ___tm = window.setTimeout; window.setTimeout = function(fn) { ___tm(fn, 0)}; // remove the stupid setTimeout in JSX live editor</script>
