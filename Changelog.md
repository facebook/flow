###v0.14.0

Likely to cause new Flow errors:

- Assignment now triggers a refinement. If you have a variable that is a `?string` and you assign 'hello' to it, Flow refines its type to 'string'.

Likely to fix old Flow errors:

- We now treat missing type parameters as `any`. For example, previously `ReactElement` was treated as `ReactElement<*, *, *>`. Now it's treated as `ReactElement<any, any, any>`.

Misc:

- Basic unsafe support for getters & setters, gated behind the config option `unsafe.enable_getters_and_setters`
- Support for block comments inside of Flow's comment syntax
- Disable by default munging of class property names that start with an underscore, with an option to enable it
- Lots of small internal fixes and merged PRs
- Basic semver support for the .flowconfig version
- Support for `declare type` in lib files
- Type annotations are now opaque - other types will not flow through them
- You can configure the tmp dir that Flow uses

###v0.13.1

Likely to cause new Flow errors:

- Restricted `+` and `+=` to only allow strings and numbers, and no longer implicitly cast objects, booleans, null or undefined. Use `String(x)` to explicitly cast these values.
- Fixed a few bugs where types shared between modules may have lost precision or weren't enforced.

Misc:

- Added `import typeof` feature that allows you to import the type of a *value* export from another module. It is sugar for: `import MyThing_tmp from "MyModule"; type MyThing = typeof MyThing_tmp;` (except it removes the need for the intermediate `MyThing_tmp` variable)
- Added `flow ast` command to print a serialized JSON [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree) AST. (Note that this AST does not include types, just syntactic structure for now)
- Added support for class expressions
- Added support for following symlinks
- Added support for number-literal and boolean-literal annotations. (useful for things like enum types and refinements based on tests of equivalence between two variables)
- Added support for ES6 binary and octal integer literals
- Added support for `export type` within a CommonJS module that also uses the `module.exports = ...` pattern
- Added support for refining some union types down to their disjoint members
- Added support for covariant Promise type parameters
- Added improved support for understanding ES5-style imperative class definitions (i.e. via functions + prototypes)
- Fixed passing `undefined` to optional parameters
- Fixed return-type tracking for tagged template usage
- Fixed an issue where library parse errors would cause the flow server to continuously restart upon initialization without giving an error

###v0.12.0

Likely to cause new Flow errors:

- Fixed a bug where declarations from libraries which are exported from one module are not checked properly in the module into which that module is imported (e.g. if `A.foo()` returns a `Promise`, and module B requires A and calls `A.foo()`, the return type of `A.foo()` was not being checked properly)
- Fixed enforcement of Object and Function type annotation arity, so that `Object<K, V>` errors
- Restricted valid computed properties, such that only strings and numbers are allowed (notably, disallows `null` and `undefined`)

New features:

- Added support for `for-of` and support for `Iterable` interface(s)
- Added support for `async`/`await`
- Added structural subtyping for interfaces -- anything can be an instance of an interface as long as it looks right
- Added support for type annotations of the form `typeof x`, where `x` is the name of an in-scope variable
- Added a new config option `suppress_comment`, a regexp which matches against comments and causes any Flow error on the next line to be suppressed. For example, `suppress_comment=.*\$FlowFixMe.*` will cause `/* $FlowFixMe */\nvar x : number = "oops";` to not raise an error.
- Added a new config option `module.name_mapper`, a regexp -> replacement template tuple to be applied to any matching module names before the Flow system resolves the name and looks it up
- Added a `--color=always|never|auto` CLI option, useful when piping to `less -R`
- Added a `--one-line` CLI option which replaces `\n` with `\\n` in multiline error messages, useful when piping to `grep`

Misc:

- Many improvements to library files, especially node and ES6 APIs
- Improved warnings on unsupported class members [PR #461]
- Added support for `export default class`
- Fixed `if (x instanceof Array)`
- Fixed the type of `x && y` when `x` is an array, object or function
- Fixed the `flow get-def` command, especially around imported types
- Fixed a bug with `==` and improved comparison-related error messages
- Fixed file watching for individual files included via .flowconfig [includes]
- Fixed the build ID, so that the server restarts when accessed from a mismatched client version
- Added a new config option `log.file` which overrides the default log file path


###v0.11.0

- We are now syncing Flow's [commit history](https://github.com/facebook/flow/commits/master) to GitHub. No more huge updating diffs. We'll also filter the changelog to the most important things.
- Big React refactoring to support ES6 React classes
- Do you use `any` to workaround things that you want to fix later? Well, now you can use `$FixMe` instead of `any` and easily grep for these workarounds later.
- We now report parsing errors in non-@flow files that you are `require()`'ing/`import`'ing
- Better error messages and better error message positions

- Basic support for `Object.freeze()`
