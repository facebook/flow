###v0.13.0-dev

Likely to cause new Flow errors:

- Restricted addition to only allow strings and numbers, and no longer implicitly cast objects, booleans, null or undefined. Use `String(x)` to explicitly cast these values.
- Fixed a few bugs where types shared between modules may have lost precision or weren't enforced.

Misc:

- Fixed passing `undefined` to optional parameters
- Added new `import typeof` feature that allows you to import the type of a *value* export from another module. It is sugar for: `import MyThing_tmp from "MyModule"; type MyThing = typeof MyThing_tmp;` (except it removes the need for the intermediate `MyThing_tmp` variable)
- Added support for class expressions
- It is now possible to use `export type` and `module.exports =` simultaneously in the same module

###v0.12.0

Likely to cause new Flow errors:

- Fixed a bug where declarations from libraries which are exported from one module are not checked properly in the module into which that module is imported (e.g. if `A.foo()` returns a `Promise`, and module B requires A and calls `A.foo()`, the return type of `A.foo()` was not being checked properly)
- Fixed enforcement of Object and Function type annotation arity, so that `Object<K, V>` errors
- Restricted valid computed properties, such that only strings and numbers are allowed (notably, disallows `null` and `undefined`)

New features:

- Added support for `for-of` and support for `Iterable` interface(s)
- Added support for `async`/`await`
- Added structural subtyping for interfaces -- anything can be an instance of an interface as long as it looks right
- Added support for type annotations of the form `typeof x`, where `x` is the name of an in-scope variable
- Added a new config option `suppress_comment`, a regexp which matches against comments and causes any Flow error on the next line to be suppressed. For example, `suppress_comment=.*\$FlowFixMe.*` will cause `/* $FlowFixMe */\nvar x : number = "oops";` to not raise an error.
- Added a new config option `module.name_mapper`, a regexp -> replacement template tuple to be applied to any matching module names before the Flow system resolves the name and looks it up
- Added a `--color=always|never|auto` CLI option, useful when piping to `less -R`
- Added a `--one-line` CLI option which replaces `\n` with `\\n` in multiline error messages, useful when piping to `grep`

Misc:

- Many improvements to library files, especially node and ES6 APIs
- Improved warnings on unsupported class members [PR #461]
- Added support for `export default class`
- Fixed `if (x instanceof Array)`
- Fixed the type of `x && y` when `x` is an array, object or function
- Fixed the `flow get-def` command, especially around imported types
- Fixed a bug with `==` and improved comparison-related error messages
- Fixed file watching for individual files included via .flowconfig [includes]
- Fixed the build ID, so that the server restarts when accessed from a mismatched client version
- Added a new config option `log.file` which overrides the default log file path
