Flow is a static typechecker for JavaScript. To find out more about Flow, check out [flow.org](https://flow.org/).

For more background information on the project, please read [this overview](https://flow.org/en/docs/lang/).

## Requirements

Flow works with:

* macOS (x86_64)
* Linux (x86_64 and arm64)
* Windows (x86_64, Windows 10 recommended)

There are [binary distributions](https://github.com/facebook/flow/releases) for each of these platforms and you can also build it from source on any of them as well.

## Using Flow

Check out the [installation instructions](https://flow.org/en/docs/install/), and then [the usage docs](https://flow.org/en/docs/usage/).

## Using Flow's parser from JavaScript

While Flow is written in OCaml, its parser is available as a compiled-to-JavaScript module published to npm, named [flow-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flow-parser). **Most end users of Flow
will not need to use this parser directly**, but JavaScript packages which make use of parsing
Flow-typed JavaScript can use this to generate Flow's syntax tree with annotated types attached.

## Building Flow from source

Flow is written in OCaml (OCaml 4.09.1 is required).

1. Install system dependencies:

    - Mac: `brew install opam`
    - Debian: `sudo apt-get install opam`
    - Other Linux: see [opam docs](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)
    - Windows: [cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) and a number of dependencies like `make`, `gcc` and `g++` are required.

      One way to install everything is to install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and then run `.\scripts\windows\install_deps.ps1` and `.\scripts\windows\install_opam.ps1`. Otherwise, see the "Manual Installation" section of [OCaml for Windows docs](https://fdopen.github.io/opam-repository-mingw/installation/) and install all of the packages listed in our `install_deps.ps1`.

      The remainder of these instructions should be run inside the Cygwin shell: `C:\tools\cygwin\Cygwin`. Then `cd /cygdrive/c/Users/you/path/to/checkout`.

2. Validate the `opam` version is `2.x.x`:

    ```sh
    opam --version
    ```

    The following instructions expect `2.x.x`. Should your package manager have installed a `1.x.x` version, please refer to the [opam docs](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) to install a newer version manually.

3. Initialize `opam`:

    ```sh
    # on Mac and Linux:
    opam init

    # on Windows:
    scripts/windows/init_opam.sh
    ```

4. Install Flow's OCaml dependencies:

    ```sh
    # from within this git checkout
    make deps
    ```

5. Build the `flow` binary:

    ```sh
    eval $(opam env)
    make
    ```

    This produces the `bin/flow` binary.

6. Build `flow.js` (optional):

    ```sh
    opam install -y js_of_ocaml.3.7.1
    make js
    ```

    This produces `bin/flow.js`.

    The Flow parser can also be compiled to JavaScript. [Read how here](src/parser/README.md).

## Running the tests

To run the tests, first compile flow using `make`. Then run `bash ./runtests.sh bin/flow`

There is a `make test` target that compiles and runs tests.

To run a subset of the tests you can pass a second argument to the `runtests.sh` file.

For example: `bash runtests.sh bin/flow class | grep -v 'SKIP'`
