The flow command line tool is made to be easy-to-use for simple cases.

Using the command `flow` will type-check your current directory if the
`.flowconfig` file is present. A flow server will automatically be started if
needed.

The CLI tool also provides several other options and commands that allow you to
control the server and build tools that integrate with Flow. For example, this
is how the [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) editor integrates with Flow to
provide autocompletion, type errors, etc. in its UI.

To find out more about the CLI just type:

```sh
flow --help
```

This will give you information about everything that flow can do. Running this
command should print something like this:

```

can use this command:

```sh
flow autocomplete --help
```
