[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has several editor
integrations for using Flow.

### Flow-Language-Support <a class="toc" id="toc-flow-language-support" href="#toc-flow-language-support"></a>

[Flow Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flowtype.flow-for-vscode)
provides all the functionality you would expect â€” linting, intellisense, type
tooltips and click-to-definition. It's stable and under active development.
However, it currently lacks on-the-fly linting and only shows you type errors
after you save a file.

### Others <a class="toc" id="toc-others" href="#toc-others"></a>

Other extensions that you may try are:

- [vscode-flow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rtorr.vscode-flow)
- [vscode-flow-ide](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gcazaciuc.vscode-flow-ide)
