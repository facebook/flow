# Need help?

**Flow** is worked on full-time by Facebook's developer infrastructure team. They're often around and available for questions.

## Stack Overflow

The [flowtype](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flowtype) tag on Stack Overflow is a great place to ask questions and find answers.

## GitHub issues

To report a bug, please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues). This is also a good place to ask questions, but it's harder to find answers once an issue has been closed.

## Gitter

You can also find a bunch of Flow users hanging out in the [#flow](https://gitter.im/facebook/flow) Gitter channel

## IRC

Many developers and users idle on Freenode.net's IRC network in the [#flowtype](irc://chat.freenode.net/flowtype) channel.

## Twitter

[@flowtype](https://twitter.com/flowtype) and [#flowtype](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23flowtype) on Twitter are used to keep up with the latest Flow news.
