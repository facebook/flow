  Tired of having to run your code to find bugs? Flow identifies problems as you
  code. Stop wasting your time guessing and checking.

homepage_code_smarter_img_alt: ""
homepage_code_smarter_description: >
  It's hard to build smart tools for dynamic languages like JavaScript. Flow
  understands your code and makes its knowledge available, enabling other smart
  tools to be built on top of Flow.

homepage_code_confidently_description: >
  Making major changes to large codebases can be scary. Flow helps you refactor
  safely, so you can focus on the changes you want to make, and stop worrying
  about what you might break.

homepage_code_bigger_description: >
  Working in a codebase with lots of developers can make it difficult to keep
  your master branch working. Flow can help prevent bad rebases. Flow can help
  protect your carefully designed library from misuse and misinterpretation.
  And Flow can help you understand the code you wrote six months ago.

homepage_featurettes:
  - title: "Type Inference"
    description: >
      Using data flow analysis, Flow infers types and tracks data as it moves
      through your code. You don't need to fully annotate your code before Flow
      can start to find bugs.
  - title: "JavaScript, Your Way"
    description: >
      Flow is designed to understand idiomatic JavaScript. It understands common
      JavaScript patterns and many of the weird things we JavaScript developers
      love to do.
  - title: "Realtime Feedback"
    description: >
      Flow gives you fast feedback while you code by incrementally rechecking
      your code as you make changes.
  - title: "Easy Integration"
    description: >
      Flow integrates well with many tools, making it easy to insert into your
      existing workflow and toolchain.
