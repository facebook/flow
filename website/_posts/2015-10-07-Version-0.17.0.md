Today we released Flow v0.17.0! The first thing you may notice is that we changed the way we display errors at the command line. The new errors look like this:

![New error format]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/new_error_format_v0_17_0.png)

This should hopefully help our command line users understand many errors without having to refer to their source code. We'll keep iterating on this format, so tell us what you like and what you don't like! Thanks to [@frantic](https://github.com/frantic) for building this feature!

There are a whole bunch of other features and fixes in this release! Head on over to our [Release](https://github.com/facebook/flow/releases/tag/v0.17.0) for the full list!
