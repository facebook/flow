### Flow in the F8 App

There are many apps using Flow, but we wanted to highlight the app released for the 2016 F8 conference. The event itself is over, but the conference app has been open-sourced and released to all. The app was built fully in React Native, and the great news is - it uses Flow!

Alongside the release of the app, Facebook created a [tutorial series](http://makeitopen.com/) called [Makeitopen.com](http://makeitopen.com/) that would document the development of the app and serve as a kind of guidebook to the app's source code. Flow is featured heavily in the [Testing a React Native app](http://makeitopen.com/tutorials/building-the-f8-app/testing/) part of the tutorial series, highlighting the way Flow was used in concert with the [Nuclide editor](http://nuclide.io/) to reduce the debugging and testing steps of development. 

You can also [grab the source code of the app](https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app) and have a look at how it uses Flow.
