On Friday we released Flow v0.16.0! We had some major perf improvements that we wanted to get into a release, plus let/const support was ready (thanks again [@samwgoldman](https://github.com/samwgoldman))!

As always, the [Changelog](https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/Changelog.md#v0160) is best at summing up the big changes.
