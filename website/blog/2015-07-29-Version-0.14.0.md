It has come to our attention that not everyone obsessively checks GitHub for Flow releases. This came as a surprise, but we would like to support these users too. Therefore, we will start announcing each Flow release on the blog, starting with this release.

So here is Flow v0.14.0! Check out the [Changelog](https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/Changelog.md#v0140) for the canonical list of what has changed.
