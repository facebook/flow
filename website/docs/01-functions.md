Functions are ubiquitous in JavaScript. As expected, Flow propagates types through function calls.

## Type Annotating Functions

```js +line_numbers
/* @flow */
function foo(x: string): string { return x; }
var x: number = foo('');
```

Running Flow produces the following error:

```text
file.js:2:26,31: string
This type is incompatible with
  file.js:3:8,13: number
```
{: .cli-error}

## Open methods

In JavaScript, functions also take an implicit `this` parameter, and can
therefore serve as open methods for objects that have such functions as
properties: the `this` parameter is bound to whatever object the method is
called on. Flow understands such behavior and propagates types through `this`
as well. For example, the following code does not typecheck:

```js +line_numbers
/* @flow */
function foo(x) { return this.x; }
var o = { x: 42, f: foo };
var x: string = o.f();
```

```text
file.js:3:14,15: number
This type is incompatible with
  file.js:4:8,13: string

file.js:4:17,21: call of method f
Too few arguments (expected default/rest parameters in function)
  file.js:2:1,34: function
```
{: .cli-error}


## Variadics

Functions can take optional and rest parameters, and calls to such functions
are checked as expected. For example, the following code typechecks:

```js +line_numbers
/* @flow */
function foo(x, y = false) { }
function bar(z, ...w) { }
foo(0);
bar('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o');
```

Calls are matched against function signatures following the usual rules of
argument matching while taking into account optional/rest parameters.

When checking the body of a function, types of optional parameters are considered [optional](http://flowtype.org/docs/nullable-types.html#_) unless default values are provided.

### Too Few Arguments

When you call a function with fewer arguments than it accepts, the `void` type
will be flowed to the missing parameters. If the missing parameter does not
accept values of type `void` then you will get an error.

```js +line_numbers
/* @flow */
function takesANumber(x: number) {}
takesANumber() // Error: undefined passed to x, which expects a number
```

However, if the missing parameter accepts values of type `void` then there will
be no error.

```js +line_numbers
/* @flow */
function canTakeNoArgs(a: void, b: ?number, c?: number) {}
canTakeNoArgs();
```

### Too Many Arguments

In JavaScript you can call a function with more arguments than it expects. Flow
allows this too. However, there is an easy trick to declare a function can't
take extra arguments.

```js +line_numbers
/* @flow */
function takesOnlyOneNumber(x: number, ...rest: Array<void>) {}
takesOnlyOneNumber(1, 2) // Error: 2 does not have the type void
```

This is particularly useful when declaring overloads in lib files.

```js +line_numbers
/* @flow */
// The first overload matches 0 args, the second matches 1 arg, the third
// matches 2 args
declare function foo(...rest: Array<void>): string;
declare function foo(a: number, ...rest: Array<void>): string;
declare function foo(a: number, b: number, ...rest: Array<void>): string;
```

## Function-based type annotations

Since functions are first-class values in JavaScript (meaning they can be
passed around, like numbers), type annotations may include function types. A
function type is of the form `(P1: T1, .., Pn: Tn) => U` where each `Ti` is a
parameter type, `U` is the return type, and each `Pi` is one of the following:

- an identifier `x`, suggesting a name for a regular parameter
- of the form `x?`, indicating an optional parameter
- of the form `...x`, indicating a rest parameter

There may be at most one rest parameter, which has to appear at the end, and
optional parameters must follow regular parameters.

Furthermore, function expressions and function definitions may have parts of
their types annotated inline, as seen above. For example, we may have:

`function foo (P1: T1, .., Pn: Tn): U { .. }`

### ES2015 features

Default values assigned to parameters must come after the parameter's type annotation:

`function foo (P1: T1 = V): U { .. }`

Arrow functions can be annotated in a similar way:

`(P1: T1 .., Pn: Tn): U => { .. }`

## Polymorphic functions
Functions can be polymorphic, just like polymorphic classes.

```js +line_numbers
/* @flow */
function foo<X>(x: X): X { return x; }

var x: number = foo(0);
var y: string = foo('');
```

Furthermore, you may have polymorphic methods in polymorphic classes. For
example, you may define a List class with a map method:

```js +line_numbers
/* @flow */
class List<T> {
  ...
  map<U>(f: (x: T) => U): List<U> { ... }
}
```

This means that for every instantiation of `T`, there is a polymorphic method
for objects of type `List<T>` that, for any instantiation of `U`, takes a
function of type `(x: T) => U` and returns an object of type `List<U>`.

## Overloading

Some methods, such as `replace()` in `String` and (the polymorphic method)
`then()` in (the polymorphic class) `Promise`, have multiple signatures to
model slightly different use cases that otherwise make sense to group into a single method.

Flow understands such "overloaded" signatures and knows how to apply the
correct one for a given call. In fact, the addition operator is a special case
of an overloaded function that returns number in some cases and string in
others, based on the types of its arguments.

Sometimes, multiple signatures are not needed to express overloading: the signatures can
be coalesced using [union types](http://flowtype.org/docs/union-intersection-types.html#_).
Flow provides the following syntax for union types:

`T1 | .. | Tn`

is the union of types `Ti`. Union types are available for general use.

As specific cases, the overloaded signatures of both `replace()` in `String` and `then()` in `Promise` have been rewritten to use union types, thereby compressing a combinatorial number of signatures into one. In general this is possible whenever return types do not depend on the specific choice and combination of argument types, which is often the case in JavaScript due to lack of overloading support at run time.

### Overloading Caution

Overloading is not recommended in general in a dynamic language, because it
can be very confusing, and often results in performance penalties. Flow does not yet provide a way to declare overloaded signatures for definitions outside the prelude, so it is not available for general use.

Curiously, there is no actual overloading at run time in JavaScript (since
there are no static types at run time). Instead, an overloaded function is
implemented by a function that accepts several possible arguments and then
does a series of dynamic type tests in its body to dispatch accordingly. This
has an interesting effect: since type signatures reflect the truth about
implementations, it often turns out that a set of overloaded signatures can be
simplified to a single signature using a union type for some parameters.
