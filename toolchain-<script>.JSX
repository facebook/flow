You Might Not Need a Toolchain
If you don’t experience the problems described above or don’t feel comfortable using JavaScript tools yet, consider adding React as a plain <script> tag on an HTML page, optionally with JSX.

This is also the easiest way to integrate React into an existing website. You can always add a larger toolchain if you find it helpful!

Recommended Toolchains
The React team primarily recommends these solutions:

If you’re learning React or creating a new single-page app, use Create React App.
If you’re building a server-rendered website with Node.js, try Next.js.
If you’re building a static content-oriented website, try Gatsby.
If you’re building a component library or integrating with an existing codebase, try More Flexible Toolchains.
