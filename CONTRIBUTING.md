We require contributors to sign our Contributor License Agreement. In order for us to review and merge your code, please sign up at https://code.facebook.com/cla. If you have any questions, please drop us a line at cla@fb.com.

You are also expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), so please read that if you are a new contributor.

If you intend to contribute something that is NOT a library definition or documentation change,
please open a "discussion" issue first to ensure that your work aligns with the Flow team's goals.

Thanks!
