Thank you for choosing to upgrade Flow. In every release the Flow community adds
new features and improves the performance of Flow to better serve you and your
team. Upgrading gives you the best that Flow has to offer.

Sometimes Flow will release breaking changes when they make sense or Flow has a
new best practice that your code can be upgraded to take advantage of. This
script will try its best to upgrade your codebase to the latest behavior and
best practices in the next version of Flow.

After running this script you may have new errors when you run Flow, or this
script may transform your code in a way that you do not want. Before running
${titleStyled}, make sure that you have a backup of your codebase. (If you are
using git make sure you've commit the changes in your working directory.) After
running ${titleStyled} review the changes that were made and manually tweak
your code until you are happy with the upgrade.

The Flow version you're upgrading from: ${chalk.bold.magenta(currentVersion)}
The Flow version you're upgrading to:   ${chalk.bold.green(nextVersion)}

We will assume that your code is valid Flow ${chalk.bold.magenta(
      currentVersion,
    )} code.

We will be running the following steps to upgrade your codebase. Each step will
print a short message explaining what it does before it runs, but we won't stop
to ask you for reconfirmation once we begin upgrading.

${allUpgrades.map((u, i) => Styled.upgradeTitle(u.title, i + 1)).join('\n')}

Today we will be upgrading all JavaScript files using Flow in: ${chalk.bold.magenta(
      directory,
    )}

Excluding any JavaScript files in node_modules directories, in flow-typed
directories, in __flowtests__ directories, or files ending in -flowtest.js.
