// Phase D1 / task #13 sub-test 1: API-surface diff.
//
// `flow-parser-oxidized` is intended as a drop-in replacement for
// `hermes-parser`. This suite asserts that the public export surface of our
// package is a superset of upstream: every name upstream exports is also
// exported by us, and the `typeof` of each shared export agrees.
//
// We intentionally allow our package to export *additional* names — the
// distinction between "drop-in replacement" and "exact mirror" is that callers
// who follow the upstream-documented API must continue to work; callers who
// reach into undocumented internals are not supported either way. The list of
// our package's *extra* exports (compared to upstream) is recorded as a
// snapshot so any future addition is reviewed.
//
// Pin: hermes-parser/hermes-estree are pinned to 0.35.0 in devDependencies,
// which matches the vendored upstream source under
// xplat/static_h/tools/hermes-parser/. If the pin moves, the
// adapter-fixup audit (ADAPTER_GAPS.md) needs to be re-run against the new
// upstream behavior.

const upstream = require('hermes-parser');
