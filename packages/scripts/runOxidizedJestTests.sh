# schedules `oxidized_jest_test` and `wasm_parser_contract_test` in

# `dist/index.js` (un-stripped Flow `import type` lines from the cp -r
# step) while target B's `yarn build` is mid-flight, surfacing as
#   `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` or
#   `TypeError: FlowParserWASMModule is not a function`.
# Hold the lock through both `yarn build` AND the jest run so a concurrent
# target can't clobber `dist/` while we're reading from it.
