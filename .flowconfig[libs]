The [libs] section in a .flowconfig file tells Flow to include the specified library definitions when type checking your code. Multiple libraries can be specified. By default, the flow-typed folder in your project root directory is included as a library directory. This default allows you to use flow-typed to install library definitions without additional configuration.

Each line in the [libs] section is a path to the library file or directory which you would like to include. These paths can be relative to the project root directory or absolute. Including a directory recursively includes all the files under that directory as library files.
