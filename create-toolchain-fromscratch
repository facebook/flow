Creating a Toolchain from Scratch
A JavaScript build toolchain typically consists of:

A package manager, such as Yarn or npm. It lets you take advantage of a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, and easily install or update them.
A bundler, such as webpack or Parcel. It lets you write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time.
A compiler such as Babel. It lets you write modern JavaScript code that still works in older browsers.
If you prefer to set up your own JavaScript toolchain from scratch, check out this guide that re-creates some of the Create React App functionality.

Donâ€™t forget to ensure your custom toolchain is correctly set up for production
