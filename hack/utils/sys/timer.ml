(* Warning: This is the ONLY code that should be using sigalrm. Any code using it should use Timer
 * instead.
 *
 * This is a timer which lets you schedule callbacks to be invoked later. There are a few things
 * you should know:
 *
 * 1. Timer will not work on Windows, since Unix.setitimer is not implemented there. If you are
 *    building a cross-platform feature, you'll need a Windows-specific implementation. For example,
 *    Timeout uses select instead of timers to implement timeouts on Windows.
 * 2. Timer is built using signals, which can cause your Unix calls to error with EINTR, since
 *    you are interupting them. Not a huge deal, just worth being aware of.
 *
 * The Timer implementation generally works as follows:
 *
 * 1. We keep a priority queue of timers, where the shortest timer is at the front
 * 2. The shortest timer is popped off the priority queue and put in current_timer
 * 3. We set a Unix timer to fire when current_timer is due
 * 4. When the Unix timer fires, we execute the current timer's callback and schedule the next timer
