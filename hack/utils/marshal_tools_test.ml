(** This tests ensures that marshaling over an FD sent over Unix Domain
 * Sockets preserves the read position in the FD.
 *
 * Steps:
   * Spawn 2 child processes (1 and 2) with sockets to each (fd1 and fd2).
   * Child 2 sends 2 messages over its FD (message_1 and messsage_2).
   * Parent reads marshaled message from fd2 (should be message_1).
   * Parent sends fd2 to child 1 over fd1.
   * Child 1 process reads a marshaled message from the FD it got (should
   *   resume reading where parent left off, thus should be message_2).
