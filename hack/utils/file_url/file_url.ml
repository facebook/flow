 * Turns an absolute path into a file uri
 *
 * The absolute path must be either unix-style absolute path "/path" or
 * dos-style "c:\path" (in which case it treats both forward- and back-slashes
 * as path separators, and converts both to forward-slash, as per URL rules).
 *
 * It rejects unc-style paths "\\?\c:\path" or "\\server\share\path".
 * This function merely guarantees that valid absolute paths will give valid
 * file URLs; it doesn't also validate that what's been given is a perfectly
 * well-formed path. For instance, if the path has ? or * or : characters,
 * it will accept them and render them as %3F and * and :. This function also
 * doesn't do escaping - e.g.  if given "he\\o" it treats this as a filename
 * with two backslashes rather than one. It's therefore impossible to create
 * a file url which has forward slashes as part of a file/directory-name; all
 * slashes will be interpreted as path separators.
