(* In ocaml, backtraces (the path that the exception bubbled up after being thrown) are stored as
 * global state and NOT with the exception itself. This means the only safe place to ever read the
 * backtrace is immediately after the exception is caught in the `with` block of a `try...with`.
 *
 * Proper use of this module is something like
 *
 *  try
 *    ...
 *  with exn ->
 *    let e = Exception.wrap exn in (* DO THIS FIRST!!! *)
 *    my_fun e; (* If this code throws internally it will overwrite the global backtrace *)
 *    Exception.reraise e
 *)

(* The inverse of `wrap`, returns the wrapped `exn`. You might use this to pattern
   match on the raw exception or print it, but should not reraise it since it
   will not include the correct backtrace; use `reraise` instead. *)

(* Like `wrap`, but for the unusual case where you want to create an `Exception`
   for an un-raised `exn`, capturing its stack trace. If you've caught an exception,
   you should use `wrap` instead, since it already has a stack trace. *)
