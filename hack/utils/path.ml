 * ~/foo -> /home/bob/foo if $HOME = "/home/bob"
 * ~joe/foo -> /home/joe/foo if joe's home is /home/joe

 * Resolves a path (using realpath)
 *
 * The advantage of using a path instead of strings is that you
 * don't need to care about symlinks or trailing slashes: each
 * path gets normalized by calling realpath.
 *
 * A few things to keep in mind:
 * - paths are always absolute. So the empty string "" becomes
 *   the current directory (in absolute)
