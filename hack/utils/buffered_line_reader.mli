 * This module is needed because Unix.select doesn't play well with
 * input_line on Ocaml channels.. i.e., when a buffered read into an
 * Ocaml channel consumes two complete lines from the file descriptor, the next
 * select will say there is nothing to read when in fact there is
 * something in the channel. This wouldn't be a problem if Ocaml channel's API
 * supported a "has buffered content" call, so you could check if the
 * buffer contains something as well as doing a Unix select to know for real if
 * there is content coming.
 *
 * The "has_buffered_content" method below does exactly that.
