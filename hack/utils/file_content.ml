(* UTF-8 encoding character lengths.
 *
 * NOTE: at the moment, edit commands are the only place where we count
 * UTF-8 encoded characters as opposed to ASCII bytes - in all of the other
 * places (column numbers in errors, positions in IDE commands) we still use the
 * latter.
 *
 * We make an exception here because that's the way Nuclide counts characters,
 * and the consequences of mishandling it are much more dire than in other
 * places - we'll not only fail the current single request, but diverge
 * the synchronized state forever.
