(** Spawning new process *)

(* In the absence of 'fork' on Windows, its usage must be restricted
   to Unix specifics parts.

   This module provides a mechanism to "spawn" new instance of the
   current program, but with a custom entry point (e.g. Slaves,
   DfindServer, ...). Then, alternate entry points should not depend
   on global references that may not have been (re)initialised in the
   new process.

   All required data must be passed through the typed channels.
   associated to the spawned process.

 *)

(* Alternate entry points *)
type ('param, 'input, 'output) entry

(* Alternate entry points must be registered at toplevel, i.e.
   every call to `Daemon.register_entry_point` must have been
   evaluated when `Daemon.check_entry_point` is called at the
   beginning of `ServerMain.start`. *)

  string -> ('param -> ('input, 'output) channel_pair -> unit) ->
  ('param, 'input, 'output) entry

(* Handler upon spawn and forked process. *)
type ('in_, 'out) handle = {
  channels : ('in_, 'out) channel_pair;
  pid : int;
}

(* Fork and run a function that communicates via the typed channels *)
val fork : ?log_file:string -> (('input, 'output) channel_pair -> unit) ->
  ('output, 'input) handle

(* for unit tests *)
val devnull : unit -> ('a, 'b) handle

(* Spawn a new instance of the current process, and execute the
   alternate entry point. *)
val spawn :
  ?reason:string -> ?log_file:string ->
  ('param, 'input, 'output) entry -> 'param -> ('output, 'input) handle

(* Close the typed channels associated to a 'spawned' child. *)
val close : ('a, 'b) handle -> unit

(* Kill a 'spawned' child and close the associated typed channels. *)
val kill : ('a, 'b) handle -> unit

(* Main function, that execute a alternate entry point.
   It should be called only once. Just before the main entry point.
   This function does not return when a custom entry point is selected. *)
