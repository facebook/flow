(*****************************************************************************)
(* A modified maybe monad
 * Most of the time, I prefer to use exceptions, I like things to blow up
 * if something went wrong.
 * However, in the case of dfind, exceptions are painful. We don't want things
 * to blow-up, we want to carry-on whatever happens.
 * So this monad never fails, it logs very nasty errors, for example, it will
 * log the fact that a watch couldn't be created, when the file still exists.
