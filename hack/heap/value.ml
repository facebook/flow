(* Very simple module used to make sure we don't mix keys of different
 * type in the heap (cf shared.ml).
 * Because we have to "create" a new module every time, we have to make a new
 * prefix (cf prefix.ml). Since the prefixes are always different (for each
 * call to make), we are sure that they are not colliding.
