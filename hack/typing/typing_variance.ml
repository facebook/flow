 * For every type inferred, we keep a witness (a position in the source),

(* `as` constraints must be contravariant and `super` constraints covariant. To
 * see why, suppose that we allow the wrong variance:
 *
 *   class Foo<+T> {
 *     public function bar<Tu as T>(Tu $x) {}
 *   }
 *
 * Let A and B be classes, with B a subtype of A. Then
 *
 *   function f(Foo<A> $x) {
 *     $x->(new A());
 *   }
 *
 * typechecks. However, covariance means that we could call `f()` with an
 * instance of B. However, B::bar would expect its argument $x to be a subtype
 * of B, but we would be passing an instance of A to it, which should be a type
 * error. In other words, `as` constraints are upper type bounds, and since
 * subtypes must have more relaxed constraints than their supertypes, `as`
 * constraints must be contravariant. (Reversing this argument shows that
 * `super` constraints must be covariant.)
 *
 * The preceding discussion might lead one to think that the constraints should
 * have the same variance as the class parameter types, i.e. that `as`
 * constraints used in the return type should be covariant. In particular,
 * suppose
 *
 *   class Foo<-T> {
 *     public function bar<Tu as T>(Tu $x): Tu { ... }
 *     public function baz<Tu as T>(): Tu { ... }
 *   }
 *
 *   class A {}
 *   class B extends A {
 *     public function qux() {}
 *   }
 *
 *   function f(Foo<B> $x) {
 *     $x->baz()->qux();
 *   }
 *
 * Now `f($x)` could be a runtime error if `$x` was an instance of Foo<A>, and
 * it seems like we should enforce covariance on Tu. However, the real problem
 * is that constraints apply to _instantiation_, not usage. As far as Hack
 * knows, $x->bar() could be of any type, since we have not provided any clues
 * about how `Tu` should be instantiated. In fact `$x->bar()->whatever()`
 * succeeds as well, because `Tu` is of type Tany -- though in an ideal world
 * we would make it Tmixed in order to ensure soundness. Also, the signature
 * of `baz()` doesn't entirely make sense -- why constrain Tu if it it's only
 * getting used in one place?
 *
 * Thus, if one wants type safety, how `$x` _should_ be used is
 *
 *   function f(Foo<B> $x) {
 *     $x->bar(new B()))->qux();
 *   }
 *
 * Thus we can see that, if `$x` is used correctly (or if we enforced correct
 * use by returning Tmixed for uninstantiated type variables), we would always
 * know the exact type of Tu, and Tu can be validly used in both co- and
 * contravariant positions.
 *
 * Remark: This is far more intuitive if you think about how Vector::concat is
 * typed with its `Tu super T` type in both the parameter and return type
 * positions. Uninstantiated `super` types are less likely to cause confusion,
 * however -- you can't imagine doing very much with a returned value that is
 * some (unspecified) supertype of a class.
