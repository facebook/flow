 * or subtyping of a type that isn't captured by the type itself. This is
 * currently managed manually by unify and sub_type, but TODO we should probably
 * have some sort of "apply" function that handles this sort of thing for
 * recursive (but not corecursive) functions, managing to make sure they don't
 * get stuck in a loop with Tvar, mapping across Tunresolved, dealing with "as"
 * constraints, etc. *)
