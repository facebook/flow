(* Pass to check for unsequenced modifications to local variables.
 *
 * PHP has a somewhat weird evaluation order (technically unspecified,
 * but...) that can cause us trouble. Evaluation is *usually*
 * left-to-right except that for certain operators, if the left hand side
 * is a variable, it is right-to-left.
 *
 * If we didn't handle this in some way, the typechecker would be unsound,
 * since code like '$x + f($x = array())' typechecks if you assume
 * left-to-right evaluation but will fail at runtime.
 *
 * We deal with this by outlawing unsequenced modification and access
 * to local variables. We consider certain operations to be "sequencing";
 * (that is, they sequence their subexpressions)
 * two expressions are unsequenced if their least common
 * ancestor in the syntax tree is *not* sequencing.
 *
 * Basically everything is sequencing except:
 *   all binops except && and ||, array/object accesses,
 *   array field specifiers, list(...),
 *   assignment (sort of; '$x = $x+1' is OK, '$x = $x++' is not)
 * (The first three correspond to when eval order can get reversed;
 *  the others just correspond to bad code.)
 *
 * This all solves the unsoundness problem without needing to commit the
 * typechecker to exactly understanding the evaluation order and also
 * closes off most of the ways a strict Hack program can observe unusual
 * evaluation order (side-effectful __toString methods can observe it;
 * maybe other ways also).
 *
