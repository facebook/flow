  (* "Any" is the type of a variable with a missing annotation, and "mixed" is
   * the type of a variable annotated as "mixed". THESE TWO ARE VERY DIFFERENT!
   * Any unifies with anything, i.e., it is both a supertype and subtype of any
   * other type. You can do literally anything to it; it's the "trust me" type.
   * Mixed, on the other hand, is only a supertype of everything. You need to do
   * a case analysis to figure out what it is (i.e., its elimination form).
   *
   * Here's an example to demonstrate:
   *
   * function f($x): int {
   *   return $x + 1;
   * }
   *
   * In that example, $x has type Tany. This unifies with anything, so adding
   * one to it is allowed, and returning that as int is allowed.
   *
   * In contrast, if $x were annotated as mixed, adding one to that would be
   * a type error -- mixed is not a subtype of int, and you must be a subtype
   * of int to take part in addition. (The converse is true though -- int is a
   * subtype of mixed.) A case analysis would need to be done on $x, via
   * is_int or similar.

  (* The type of the various forms of "array":
   * Tarray (None, None)         => "array"
   * Tarray (Some ty, None)      => "array<ty>"
   * Tarray (Some ty1, Some ty2) => "array<ty1, ty2>"

  (* The type of a generic inside a function using that generic, with an
   * optional "as" constraint. For example:
   *

   *   // ...

   *
   * The type of $x inside the body of f() is Tgeneric("T", Some(Tprim Tint))

   * include "Hindley-Milner type inference", "unification", and "algorithm W".

  | Tvar          of Ident.t

  (* A wrapper around fun_type, which contains the full type information for a
   * function, method, lambda, etc. Note that lambdas have an additional layer
   * of indirection before you get to Tfun -- see Tanon below. *)
  | Tfun          of fun_type

  (* The type of an opaque type alias ("newtype"), outside of the file where it
   * was defined. They are "opaque", which means that they only unify with
   * themselves. However, it is possible to have a constraint that allows us to
   * relax this. For example:
   *
   * newtype my_type as int = ...
   *
   * Outside of the file where the type was defined, this translates to:
   *
   * Tabstract ((pos, "my_type"), [], Some (Tprim Tint))
   *
   * Which means that my_type is abstract, but is subtype of int as well.

  (* This is a kinda-union-type we use in order to defer picking which common
   * ancestor for a type we should use until we hit a type annotation.
   * For example:
   *
   * interface I {}
   * class C implements I {}
   * class D extends C {}
   * function f(): I {
   *   if (...) {
   *     $x = new C();
   *   } else {
   *     $x = new D();
   *   }
   *   return $x;
   * }
   *
   * What is the type of $x? We need to pick some common ancestor, but which
   * one? Both C and I would be acceptable, which do we mean? This is where
   * Tunresolved comes in -- after the if/else, the type of $x is
   * Unresolved[C, D] -- it could be *either one*, and we defer the check until
   * we hit an annotation. In particular, when we hit the "return", we make sure
   * that it is compatible with both C and D, and then we know we've found the
   * right supertype. Since we don't do global inference, we'll always either
   * hit an annotation to check, or hit a place an annotation is missing in
   * which case we can just throw away the type.
   *
   * Note that this is *not* really a union type -- most notably, it's allowed
   * to grow as inference goes on, which union types don't. For example:
   *
   * function f(): Vector<num> {
   *   $v = Vector {};
   *   $v[] = 1;
   *   $v[] = 3.14;
   *   return $v;
   * }
   *
   * (Eliding some Tvar for clarity) On the first line, $v is
   * Vector<Unresolved[]>. On the second, Vector<Unresolved[int]>. On the third,
   * Vector<Unresolved[int,float]> -- it grows! Then when we finally return $v,
   * we see that int and float are both compatible with num, and we have found
   * our suitable supertype.
   *
   * One final implication of this growing is that if an unresolved is used in
   * a contravariant position, we must collapse it down to whatever is annotated
   * right then, in order to be sound.
   *)

  (* Tobject is an object type compatible with all objects. This type is also
