(* Module used to type DynamicYield
 * Each class that uses the DynamicYield trait or which extends a class that

 * explicitly defines a yieldFoo method, then it implicitly also defines genFoo
 * (unless this method is explicitly defined).
 * It does this with __call().

    (* In a perfect world, we could just always add to the map. This is not a
     * perfect world. It is filled with sinners and people who talk in theaters
     * and www engineers who override a synthesized gen/get/prepare method with
     * their own, physically provided in the file. Which since DY is implemented
     * with __call is the one that gets called at runtime. But you also need to
     * be able to override one DY method with another. So we need to do the
     * following:
     *
     * - If the method we're about to synthesize doesn't exist yet, just add it.
     * - If it does, check:
     * -- Is it abstract? If so, we are implementing that abstract method, we
     *    should go ahead and overwrite it.
     * -- Is its return type reason Rdynamic_yield? If so, assume that we were
     *    the ones that synthesized it in the first place and go ahead and
     *    overwrite, so you can write a more specific return type in a child
     *    class, for example. Checking the return type reason isn't terribly
     *    clean, but it's a nice convenient flag that we synthesized it. If you
     *    are reading this because it's causing problems, I'm sorry, and feel
     *    free to add something to the appropriate record type.
     * -- Otherwise, assume the version that is there was physically provided by
     *    the code author, and keep theirs instead of synthesizing our own.
     *
     * One day, there will be a Glorious Revolution and DY will be moved into
     * HHVM, and there will be perf wins and dancing angels and anti-patterns
     * like this will go away. But today is not that day. Today, there is only
     * tears and a deep, yearning hole my heart. *)
