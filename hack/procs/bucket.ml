(****************************************************************************)
(* Moduling Making buckets.
 * When we parallelize, we need to create "buckets" of tasks for the
 * workers.
 * Given a list of files, we want to split it up into buckets such that
 * every worker is busy long enough. If the bucket is too big, it hurts
 * load balancing, if it is too small, the overhead in synchronization time
 * hurts *)
