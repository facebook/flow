(* On Unix each job runs in a forked process. The first thing these jobs do is
 * deserialize a marshaled closure which is the job.
 *
 * The marshaled representation of a closure includes a MD5 digest of the code
 * segment and an offset. The digest is lazily computed, but if it has not been
 * computed before the fork, then each forked process will need to compute it.
 *
 * To avoid this, we deserialize a dummy closure before forking, so that we only
 * need to calculate the digest once per worker instead of once per job. *)

(**
 * On Windows, the Worker is a process and runs the job directly. See above.
 *
 * On Unix, the Worker is split into a Worker Master and a Worker Slave
 * process with the Master reaping the Slave's process with waitpid.
 * The Slave runs the actual job and sends the results over the oc.
 * If the Slave exits normally (exit code 0), the Master keeps living and
 * waits for the next incoming job before forking a new slave.
 *
 * If the Slave exits with a non-zero code, the Master also exits with the
 * same code. Thus, the owning process of this Worker can just waitpid
 * directly on this process and see correct exit codes.
 *
 * Except `WSIGNALED i` and `WSTOPPED i` are all compressed to `exit 2`
 * and `exit 3` respectively. Thus some resolution is lost. So if
 * the underling Worker Slave is for example SIGKILL'd by the OOM killer,
 * then the owning process won't be aware of it.
 *
 * To regain this lost resolution, controller_fd can be optionally set. The
 * real exit statuses (includinng WSIGNALED and WSTOPPED) will be sent over
 * this file descriptor to the Controller when the Worker Slave exits
 * abnormally (non-zero exit code).
