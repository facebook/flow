(* Given a type hint, break it up into an (optional) underlying

 * a runtime TypeConstraint (hphp/runtime/vm/type-constraint.h).
 *
 * see determine_type_constraint{,from_annot} in
 * hphp/compiler/analysis/emitter.cpp and TypeAnnotation::vanillaName in
 * hphp/compiler/type_annotation.cpp.
 *
 * Type variables and type constants produce an empty string instead of
 * no string as their name, since that it what emitter.cpp does; this is
 * silly, probably.
 *
 * XXX: determine_type_constraint_from_annot has logic to ignore extended
 * hints for parameters (but not returns) when the constraint doesn't have
 * any of {type_var, nullable, soft, type_constant} and also does not
 * have an extended name. I don't understand how this could happen and
 * it isn't implemented here.
