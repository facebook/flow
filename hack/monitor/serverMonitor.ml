 * The server monitor is the parent process for a server. It
 * listens to a socket for client connections and passes the connections
 * to the server and serves the following objectives:
 *
   * 1) Readily accepts client connections
   * 2) Confirms a Build ID match (killing itself and the server quickly
   *    on mismatch)
   * 3) Hands the client connection to the daemon server
   * 4) Tracks when the server process crashes or OOMs and echos
   *    its fate to the next client.
