(* ================== ID NAMING INSTRUCITONS ==================== *)

(* Constants for regular expression-type commands in identifiers;
   should be separated by '_', can appear in any order.

   TODO: make validator for expression files that checks if identifiers
   are valid combinations of types

   Prefix any regex commands with the magic_prefix, "__"

   Wildcard = "ANY"
   Equivalent of grep '.' for an AST node
   For larger constructs such as classes or functions, this means that anything
   of that type will match ignoring the body.

   WildcardName "SOMENAME"
   Will match an arbitrary name (for classes, functions). Will still require
   the body of the construct to match unlike Wildcard.
   e.g. "class __SOMENAME {}" will match any empty classes.

   SkipAny = "SOMENODE"
   For stmt only (and maybe expr later): skip any number of AST constructs
   possibly going up and down in the tree.
   Difference from grep '.*' match:
   ".* stmt1 .*" will match any block that has a direct child equal to stmt1
   "... stmt1 ..." will match any block that has a descendant equal to stmt1
   TODO find a better name
   TODO implement matching for this

   Not = "NOT"
   matches when no instances of the following ast_node exist

   KStar = "KSTAR"
   equivalent of grep '.*'

   Or = "OR"
   equivalent of grep '|'

   DoNotCare = "SOMENODE"
   constant for when we want to disregard an identifier (we're just
   putting it in so the parser doesn't complain)

   Metavariable = "META"
   Metavariables similar to Pfff
   TODO: finish implementing this later *)

   any patches passed in (provided that the patches come from the
   pattern AST that was passed in *)

                     use_hh_format:bool -> string option

   has all the lines containing a match in order in the form:
   line num: line *)
