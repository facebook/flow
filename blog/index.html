<p>In this example, <code>FluffyBunny</code> is a React Component you wrote and <code>div</code> is a
JSX intrinsic. Lower-cased JSX elements are assumed to be intrinsics by React
and by Flow. Up until Flow v0.21.0, Flow ignored intrinsics and gave them the
type <code>any</code>. This meant Flow let you set any property on JSX intrinsics. Flow
v0.21.0 will, by default, do the same thing as v0.20.0, However now you can
also configure Flow to properly type your JSX intrinsics!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Version 0.21.0" href="/blog/2016/02/02/Version-0.21.0/"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h1 class="title_xvU1" itemprop="headline">Version-0.19.0</h1><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2015-12-01T00:00:00.000Z">December 1, 2015</time></div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><span class="authorName_yefp">Gabe Levi</span></div><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Flow v0.19.0 was deployed today!

<a href="https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/Changelog.md#v0190" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Changelog</a>
summarizes. The Changelog can be a little concise, though, so here are some
longer explanations for some of the changes. Hope this helps!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="noflow"><code>@noflow</code><a href="#noflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to noflow" title="Direct link to noflow">​</a></h3>
<p>Flow is opt-in by default (you add <code>@flow</code> to a file). However we noticed that
sometimes people would add Flow annotations to files that were missing <code>@flow</code>.
Often, these people didn&#x27;t notice that the file was being ignored by Flow. So
we decided to stop allowing Flow syntax in non-Flow files. This is easily fixed
by adding either <code>@flow</code> or <code>@noflow</code> to your file. The former will make the
file a Flow file. The latter will tell Flow to completely ignore the file.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="declaration-files">Declaration files<a href="#declaration-files" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Declaration files" title="Direct link to Declaration files">​</a></h3>
<p>Files that end with <code>.flow</code> are now treated specially. They are the preferred
provider of modules. That is if both <code>foo.js</code> and <code>foo.js.flow</code> exist, then
when you write <code>import Foo from &#x27;./foo&#x27;</code>, Flow will use the type exported from
<code>foo.js.flow</code> rather than <code>foo.js</code>.</p>
<p>We imagine two main ways people will use <code>.flow</code> files.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Version-0.19.0" href="/blog/2015/12/01/Version-0.19.0/"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h1 class="title_xvU1" itemprop="headline">Typing Generators with Flow</h1><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2015-11-09T00:00:00.000Z">November 9, 2015</time></div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><span class="authorName_yefp">Sam Goldman</span></div><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Flow 0.14.0 included support for generator functions.
